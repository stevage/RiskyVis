"Nedlands","Alfred Rd, Claremont","Poor or no road lighting",0,"At night or in the rain it is extremely hazardous from West Coast Highway to Brockway as there is very little street lighting, the road is narrow, and bends around. ",115.7946363019,-31.9691556938
"Nedlands","Broadway & Cooper St, Crawley","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"The very narrow carriageways on Broadway prevent there being two lanes of traffic, so very long tailback occur.

"Nedlands","Aberdare Rd & Gairdner Dr, Shenton Park","Confusing layout",1,"Travelling west on Aberdare, many cars turn right into Derby, but often indicate late. If you are behind one of these turning cars, you have to stop - but - the traffic behind zooms around you on the INSIDE. There is only ONE lane, so this ""inside passing"" is really risky. Perhaps there needs to be TWO lanes here.",115.8143091202,-31.9645055007

"Nedlands","64 & Selby St, Daglish","Confusing layout",0,"Nash St/Selby St jct has new roundabout to replace lights.  At rush hour, Nash St very busy because lights at Nash St/Railway Rd don't stay green long enough to clear out queue of cars.  Cars back up whole length of Nash St, into jct with Selby St.  With previous lights that just meant queues on Selby St.  Now it means queues on roundabout itself, with cars unsure when/where to give way.  Some cars turning left go in right lane and do full loop of roundabout to skip queue making things worse.",115.8050233126,-31.9552550365
"Nedlands","71, Swanbourne","Poor or no provision for cyclists",9,"I ride along this road frequently to train at Bold Park, and I am constantly scared as the cars are way too close and the bike lane nowhere near big enough.

I often turn right onto Smyth Rd from Aberdare Rd and having to have my right arm out whilst braking on a descent on a bumpy rd is not easy.

I understand that the vehicle movement increase will be in the order of 60,000 per week. Stirling Highway at this point cannot be widened and may need additional traffic lights within 200m of the Dalkeith Road lights.  ",115.8025074005,-31.9793953112
