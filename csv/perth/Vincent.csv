"Vincent","Scarborough Beach Rd, Mount Hawthorn","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",60,"Drivers from Green St get impatient waiting to cross the oncoming traffic onto the eastbound section of Scarborough Beach road and often take risky actions by driving across when there is not much space, and then pushing into traffic to get to the left hand lanes.

Incredibly dangerous road layout with very poor signage and nowhere to go if the guy next to you doesn't realise that the lanes merge. It is seriously a nightmare.

Cars exiting the E Perth train station car park must cross over the bike path with cyclists passing from both the NE and SW before entering onto East Parade.
