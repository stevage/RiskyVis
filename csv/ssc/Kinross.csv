Drivers entering from MacNaughton Cr wishing to take the left hand lane, are risking their lives as drivers approaching on Connolly Drive assume it is safe to just drive through on the left lane and that those entering from MacNaughton Crescent will automatically take the right hand lane. There are only two exits from Kinross and this is one of them making it very busy & dangerous.",115.7372224331,-31.7121323606
