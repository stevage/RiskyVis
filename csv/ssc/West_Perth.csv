"West Perth","George St, West Perth","Poor road markings or no edge-lines",0,"I frequently see cars reversing up the freeway on-ramp as they have inadvertently chosen the incorrect lane due to poor road markings and signage. Reversing up the on-ramp is an obvious risk to other vehicles.  This particular lane lacks road markings indicating it is for Freeway South only. Motorists select this lane thinking it is a right turn lane for Murray street. When realising their error then reverse up the on/off-ramp in order to get into the correct lane.
