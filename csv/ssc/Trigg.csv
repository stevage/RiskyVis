It�۪s 70km/hr thru the Karrinyup rd & west coast hwy lights heading south and changes to 80 straight after that. The 80 zone should start south of the Elliott rd intersection on west coast hwy as it has heavy school traffic and there have been a few accidents already. Slowing traffic, even by 10km/hr will give people more time to judge when turning onto and off the highway. ",115.7618451118,-31.8763003584
