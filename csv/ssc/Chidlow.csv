"Chidlow","Liberton Rd & Old Northam Rd, Chidlow","Tight curves or blind crests",1,"There is limited to no signage on Liberton Road when approaching Old Northam Road.  To date we have assisted at four individual incidents where the driver has no realised there is an intersection and they have ended up across the road either in the ditch or hitting the trees - lucky no one has suffered any severe injuries so far but really is only a matter of time.  I believe a roundabout at this intersection would alleviate these issues",116.2729239464,-31.8563500535
