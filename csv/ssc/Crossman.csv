"Crossman","Albany Hwy & Crossman Rd, Crossman","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",2,"No slip lane to turn into Crossman Rd off Albany Hwy, or cross the intersection. Very busy intersection for light and heavy vehicles. Speed limit passing through the intersection was raised to 110. The school bus travels this route. I have witnessed an accident first hand at this intersection. Formal letters have been written to the council, but no changes have been made.",116.5953905831,-32.7812392232
"Crossman","30, Crossman","Lacks overtaking opportunities",0,"The Albany Highway is in a generally poor condition that does not meet the needs or standard required for the drivers that use it.  It has sub standard surface quality (very potholed), little or no road edging and straight onto gravel in some areas, not enough overtaking lanes.  It needs to be a dual carriage highway from Armadale all the way to Albany, but especially from Armadale to Williams at the very least.",116.5937805176,-32.7781823137
