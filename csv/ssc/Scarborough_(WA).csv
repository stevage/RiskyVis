"Scarborough (WA)","147 Brighton Rd, Scarborough","Confusing layout",3,"Cars are banked up, it is very difficult to turn right, people get frustrated and do risky things. Also, very difficult to cross as a pedestrain. ",115.7716405392,-31.8981364112
"Scarborough (WA)","31 Brighton Rd, Scarborough","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"I have seen on many occasions drivers not allowing pedestrians to cross fully on the flashing orange signal for them to walk which is intimidating and dangerous for pedestrians crossing the road. They should have a specific walking time for pedestrians and a specific turning arrow for cars. Because this is becoming increasingly busy drivers are rushing to make the lights which makes it scary for people to cross safety.",115.7599675655,-31.8981637372
"Scarborough (WA)","Brighton Rd & West Coast Hwy, Scarborough","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",5,"Too many vehicles running the red light, even after the pedestrian walk signal turns green.

"Scarborough (WA)","71 & Pearl Pde, Scarborough","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Cars turning right out of Pearl Pde onto West Coast Hwy have two choices: (a) wait for road to be empty in both directions, and turn right in one go, or (b) wait for southbound lanes to be empty, go to median strip, then wait there until joining northbound lanes when they're free.  Picking (a) causes no problems.  But people are impatient and pick (b).  Problem is the median strip isn't wide enough to do that safely and cars frequently sit there with rear ends sticking out into southbound lanes.",115.7575052977,-31.8888792676
"Scarborough (WA)","Capel Ln & Weaponess Rd, Scarborough","Other",0,"Another City of Stirling poorly designed rotary, which because of the home owner's privacy wall on the south east corner of the Ewen St Weaponess Rd rotary, it is difficult to see vehicles coming down the hill, heading west, often at speed, when driving north along Weaponess Rd. The rotary is treated by many drivers as a chicane.",115.7718658447,-31.9000036681
"Scarborough (WA)","31 Weaponess Rd, Scarborough","Other",0,"Yet another poorly designed City of Stirling rotary at the Weaponess Rd Stewart St intersection. the geometry of the odd shaped rotary makes it difficult to see vehicles heading west along Stewart St into the rotary when driving north on Weaponess Rd and often the vehicles as they are heading down a slight hill are speeding making it even more difficult to safely enter the rotary from Weaponess Rd heading north.",115.7717370987,-31.9012424127
"Scarborough (WA)","Deanmore Rd & Moorland St, Scarborough","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",1,"The Intersection is a concentration of fast moving cars along Deanmore Rd intersecting with fast downhill traffic from Moorland St. No street signs, no road markings or any signs of traffic management. Then combine this with cars reversing into fast moving traffic from the local tennis club five metres up from the 'T' junction. Often we've witnessed drivers stopped on the intersection to receive and drop off passengers. Added to this is the hundreds of kids who cross at the intersection daily...",115.7677727938,-31.890717106700013

"Scarborough (WA)","56-70 Duke St, Scarborough","Hazardous roadside objects or trees",1,"So much construction work here and trucks double parking making it dangerous to navigate.
