"Lockyer (WA)","2 & Parker St, Lockyer","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"It's a hazard, cars trying to cross over in to the flow of the traffic have coursed problems on the parts, there has been collisions as well. I believe closing of this road and making it a dead end will make traffic flow on and off the main Round about much better",117.8647398949,-35.0038031199
"Lockyer (WA)","2 & Parker St, Lockyer","Poor or confusing signage",0,"Most drivers are confused or do not understand how to use the large roundabout here in Albany. Also the exit and entry from Parker st onto Hanrahan rd is a major problem as cars stop at the last second to turn right into Parker st and cars turning right from Parker st often have blind vision. Having lived here for 13 years I seriously think that Parker st should not enter onto Hanrahan Rd it should be blocked off and traffic could use the next road to enter this area.",117.8648525476,-35.0038360754
"Lockyer (WA)","Parker St & Playne St, Lockyer","Confusing layout",0,"Five road roundabout with a service station being built on roundabout which is very close to the exit for Bunnings and the intersecting road of south coast highway and Albany highway Roundabout is bad enough with road trains and now add a busy service station is a recipe for disaster",117.8627443314,-35.0028979365
