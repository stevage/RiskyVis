"Karramindie","94, Karramindie","Poor road surface quality",0,"Traveled this road and Great Eastern Highway recently, in our Winnebago motorhome (built on an Isuzu truck chassis), and the road surface was so bad that I was forced to drive at 50 to 60 kilometres per hour, so as not to shake the motorhome (worth more than $100,000) to pieces. This occurred on many sections both these roads between Norseman and Merridan. The amount of vehicle and fuel taxes we pay, we shouldn't have to put up with inferior quality roads - being main roads to Perth.",121.4099979401,-31.1237173912
