"Shenton Park","Subiaco Nicholson Road Po, 214 Nicholson Rd, Subiaco","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",2,"A very busy intersection for vehicles and with increasing pedestrian activation from small shop strip there needs to be better pedestrian priority. Crosswalks. Lone markings making it clear pedestrians have right of way over traffic. Signing. With bus stop on approach many Pedestrian crossing also have preference to cross away from the main intersection. The Netherlands standards for pedestrian crossings at intersections would benefit this and many other roundabout intersections",115.8150145411,-31.9564566254

"Shenton Park","Aberdare Rd & Railway Rd, Shenton Park","Poor road markings or no edge-lines",0,"Requires a dedicated turning lane as frequently the first vehicle waiting does not want to turn and every following vehicle that does want to turn has to wait thus wasting the turn only cycle of the traffic lights",115.802475214,-31.9642051312

"Shenton Park","64 & Selby St, Daglish","Confusing layout",0,"Nash St/Selby St jct has new roundabout to replace lights.  At rush hour, Nash St very busy because lights at Nash St/Railway Rd don't stay green long enough to clear out queue of cars.  Cars back up whole length of Nash St, into jct with Selby St.  With previous lights that just meant queues on Selby St.  Now it means queues on roundabout itself, with cars unsure when/where to give way.  Some cars turning left go in right lane and do full loop of roundabout to skip queue making things worse.",115.8050233126,-31.9552550365
