"Benjinup","6374-6374 Donnybrook-Boyup Brook Rd, Benjinup","Poor road surface quality",0,"We use this road a few times a week and it continues to be an issue of safety, we actually dread using it.  The road has been resurfaced several times but the work done is not up to standard with many logging and livestock trucks using this road.  The road edges are poor and unmarked for much of the road and the ability to overtake safely is limited and often dangerous.  This road needs to be looked at by a qualified engineer and its repairs done properly to fit the traffic that uses it.",116.3335418701,-33.768017359
