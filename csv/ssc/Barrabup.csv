"Barrabup","Vasse Hwy, Cundinup","Poor or no guard/barrier fencing",0,"Heading south towards Nannup, you come over the hill and head towards the St Johns brook bridge, and the road leads in a direct line off the bridge into the deep drain.  The bridge and road after is curved away.  There is no guard rail at all, and every time I pass this patch of road, it chills me how just a slight error or misjudgment would spell death, especially if the river was flooded during wet season.  Guard rails are definitely needed on north side of this bridge!!!",115.694360733,-33.82368841
