Solution: drop speed to 50k before intersection. A permanent traffic light at intersection for people to manage when crossing. A big, big round about. Remove those people (old people) helping to cross at school time because they also are at risk. Make small bridge, probably best solution. ",115.9182983637,-32.0871332643
