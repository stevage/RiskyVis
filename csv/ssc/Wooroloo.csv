"Wooroloo","94 & Old Northam Rd, Wooroloo","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",11," Many times I have had near misses to and from work if there are trucks behind me or oncoming and wishing to turn and traffic is heavy the cars braking to turn are often in danger of being wiped out from both directions. It is very unsafe and scary at times. It requires another slip lane at least so that vehicles travelling from the west, wishing to turn left onto old Northam do not back up traffic, forcing cars to swerve around, often into oncoming cars or turning right waiting in the slip lane",116.3276410103,-31.8307532183
