"Bindoon","Toodyay Rd, Gidgegannup","Poor road surface quality",0,"Road revamped Jan to Jun 2018 but a long area the road surface is substandard (as though they ran out of money/time to do the TOP/FINNISHING surface) .",116.1749267578,-31.2715084702
"Bindoon","7240-7240 Great Northern Hwy, Bindoon","Other",0,"12km north of Bindoon on Gt N Hwy the road descends from top of hill with one lane going down (Nwards) and two lanes coming up (s) so that it is possible to overtake slow moving vehicles on the ascending side.Problem is there are corners on the road and if you are going down at 100kph and come round corner to find a v slow moving truck in low gear going down you have to slow down rapidly.OK for cars but trucks swing out sometimes into overtaking lane as they can't brake in time - deadly.",116.1529541016,-31.3166879917
