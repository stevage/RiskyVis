"Booragoon","Leach Hwy, Booragoon","Other",0,"Heavy trucks travelling West at speed in the right lane refusing to allow smaller vehicles to merge when changing lanes as approaching intersection with intent of turning into shopping precinct on North side of Leach Hwy",115.8244585991,-32.0460239854
"Booragoon","Andrea Ln, Booragoon","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",2,"Vehicles do not stop at this crossing. The layout of the crossing is dangerous and has already been reported to Council and to Garden City.",115.8346349001,-32.0355493726
"Booragoon","Riseley St & Worthington Rd, Booragoon","Area requires lights/roundabout",2,"Negotiating a turn from Worthington Road onto Riseley Street (Northbound) is almost impossible during peak hours. Traffic from left and right is coming at 60-70 KMH. There is little resting space in the middle of Riseley street to pause before fully negotiating the turn, which is definitely not enough for SUVs. There have been accidents at this junction because of these issues. It definitely needs a larger resting space, or a way of stopping/slowing traffic from either end of Riseley St",115.8373814821,-32.0415746382
"Booragoon","561-563 Marmion St, Booragoon","Poorly timed traffic light system",3,"There are four sets of traffic lights in about 600m which never seem to allow for traffic flow.  The new line markings are also difficult to see and the lanes (heading east) are not in alignment which often results in motorists crossing lanes without even realising it.",115.8362281322,-32.0363929337

"Booragoon","Marmion St & Riseley St, Booragoon","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Left turn from Risely St leads into a new left lane on Marmion St. With traffic from Risely St (southbound) entering straight into the right hand lane of Marmion Street, it leaves little room to move across the right to access Garden City. Would be better served by a left arrow or a Give Way accessing both lanes.",115.8379769325,-32.0364293135
