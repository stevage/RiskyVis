"Neerabup","Hester Ave, Neerabup","Other",2,"The section of road has large volumes of vehicles turning onto the freeway from Hester Ave. With only one turn lane onto the freeway, you have two roundabouts on the approach.  Cars cut in from the through lane into the turn lane. If you look at the next freeway entry,  (NeerabupRd) that entry has two turn lanes onto the freeway. There have been numerous near miss and incidents on the Hester Rd entry, including members of our family, the roundabouts are  small, tight & dangerous.",115.7326626778,-31.6707777493
