"Cunderdin","94, Cunderdin","Lacks overtaking opportunities",0,"Between northam and merredin there is currently only three overtaking lanes (160km stretch of road), on top of this, the road surface has seriously degraded in many places. Patchy roadworks are continually failing. Increased highway traffic means near misses happen frequently when people take their lives into their hands to try and pass slow traffic - this can also lead to people speeding to ensure their safe return to the left lane after passing traffic.
