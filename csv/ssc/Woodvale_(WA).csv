"Woodvale (WA)","Woodvale Dr, Woodvale","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",0,"I see people travelling over the speed limit all the time. Given that there is a school along this road, the speeding issue makes it even more of a risk. ",115.8022391796,-31.7901628788
"Woodvale (WA)","84 & Backshall Pl, Wanneroo","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"*Have to cross 4 lanes of 80km traffic, there have been a couple of deaths at this point. *Backshall Pl is often congested as it's extremely difficult to exit to ocean reef rd (OCR), especially when traffic on OCR has come to a standstill. *People slowing down to illegally turn left into backshall Pl, which is a one way exit point only, from OCR causing near accidents on OCR. *The upcoming flyover bridge at OCR/wanneroo rd will not help matters at backshall pl, especially during construction!!",115.800032015,-31.778412588
"Woodvale (WA)","60 & 84, Pearsall","Poorly timed traffic light system",1,"The lights at the intersection of Ocean Reef Road and Wanneroo Road do not allow traffic travelling down Ocean Reef Road adequate time to cross the large intersection.

"Woodvale (WA)","Backshall Pl, Wanneroo","Other",0,"I agree with previous comment - this intersection is a death trap waiting to happen. The speed of cars of either side of the median strip is excessive, there are often as many as three vehicles parked in the centre of the road trying to get across, there are often vehicles entering Backshall off Ocean Reef despite the No Entry sign.
