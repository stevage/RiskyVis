"Carine","122-154 Duffy Rd, Carine","Other",0,"Duffy Road is being used as a rat between Reid Highway and Beach Road,it is a local road being used in a manner that is in my view and others that live on it is dangerous. There is a constant problem with speeding vehicles and it is only a matter of time before we have a serious accident. The issue was raised during the Reid Highway upgrade but nothing has been done, Okely is ear marked for an upgrade to try and ease the problem, why do we have to wait until there is a tragedy before we act.

"Carine","3, Carine","Other",0,"The 70 kph speed limit  on Reid Hwy Erindale-Marmion adds to signification congestion at Erindale/Reid and Balcatta /Reid intersections. Seems to frustrate drivers & appears to generate  more frequent lane changes on approaches. Increasing the speed limit to 80kph Erindale-Marmion with existing 70kph or even 60kph  only through Balcatta/Reid and Mitchel Fwy Reid Off ramp controlled intersections should significantly improve traffic flow. Similar roads general limits Marmion  80kph, Tonkin 100kph",115.7946968079,-31.857001616
