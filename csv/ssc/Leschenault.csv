"Leschenault","Old Coast Rd, Leschenault","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Fast moving traffic coming from the north and turning into Old Coast Road can be too quick for a driver crossing traffic to head south on the Forrest Highway. There have been some serious accidents, one only 2 weeks ago, at this intersection. Too many things to watch... traffic speeding across the intersection to Old Coast Road and traffic coming from the right heading north along the freeway at full speed. The Binningup intersection would be a better model to have used here. A rest point. ",115.7284811139,-33.231602632
