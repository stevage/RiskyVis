"Boyup Brook","876-876 Six Mile Rd, Boyup Brook","Poor road surface quality",0,"This is an un-surfaced road that is down right dangerous.  Used by heavy trucks and Agricultural vehicles the road is quickly damaged even after recent grading of the road.  This road as a main link between The Boyup brook to Kojonup road and Dinninup needs to be surfaced properly its entire length.  Having often used this road I have nearly been cleaned up over a dozen times by trucks and other uses travelling too fast on this poorly surfaced road even below the speed limit.",116.473274231,-33.8725534812
