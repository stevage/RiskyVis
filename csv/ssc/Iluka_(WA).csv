"Iluka (WA)","Shenton Ave, Iluka","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"Marmion Avenue is an 80km/h zoe and western side of Shenton Avenue is 50 km/h, eastern side is 70km/h. This is a dual lane roundabout, with no areas for cyclists to safely pass. The pedestrian crossing on the northern side of the roundabout is very close to the roundabout itself. As cars are travelling fast through the roundabout (especially when continuing on Marimion), it leaves very little time for pedestrians or cyclists to safely cross the road.

"Iluka (WA)","Shenton Ave, Iluka","Area requires lights/roundabout",0,"This roundabout is very dangerous during peak periods and NEEDS to be changed into a set of lights! During peak periods people get frustrated at the long waiting times giving way to their right and some make risky moves when they shouldn�۪t to get a foot in. This makes it dangerous for both motorists and cyclists alike. The other intersections south of here are all light-controlled and they work very well. Please consider this, I have seen many near-misses and I don�۪t even live around here.",115.7381021976,-31.7431772793
