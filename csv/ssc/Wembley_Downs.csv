"Wembley Downs","Glenelg Ave & Hale Rd, Wembley Downs","Area requires lights/roundabout",0,"Crossing Hale Road on Glenelg Avenue is a high risk.  The intersection is busy, and sits on top of the crest of the road from one direction, and around the bend from the other.  It is a last minute dash from the median strip to beat oncoming traffic which appears at the last minute, usually travelling at speed.  I feel a roundabout would make this intersection a lot safer for oncoming traffic from all directions. ",115.7780832052,-31.9133602813
"Wembley Downs","250 Weaponess Rd, Wembley Downs","Other",0,"A poorly designed rotary that because of the hill on the western side, home owner's wall and trees make this hazardous for vehicles travelling south on Weaponess Rd and entering the rotary.

Dedicated bicycle lanes need to be provided or, as much as the trees greatly improve the visual aspect of Weaponess Rd, remove them.",115.7738721371,-31.9194482135
"Wembley Downs","35-61 Valencia Ave, Churchlands","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",0,"There are many school children in this area yet the roads are not subject to reduced limits as the school is a block over.
