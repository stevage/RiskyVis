"Wagerup","Johnston Rd, Wagerup","Tight curves or blind crests",0,"After leaving the town site, the western section of road has a very large number of tight/blind bends and blind crests. Sections of the road have been widened for trucks but the danger from the tight/blind bends & crests HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED!  The bridge (east side Yarloop) is 1 car wide. Many times 2 vehicles approaching bridge don't realize it's 1 car wide & many times neither slows to allow the other to cross bridge 1st, resulting in both slamming on brakes to avoid a crash on the  bridge.
