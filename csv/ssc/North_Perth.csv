"North Perth","395-397 Charles St, North Perth","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",4,"Between Vincent St and Walcott St, this is a very dangerous road, there are many car, bike and motorcycle incidents and dangerous pedestrian crossings. There are no pedestrian bridges or underpaths causing pedestrians to take unnecessary risks to cross through heavy traffic. Not acceptable considering this is a major artery in/out of the CBC.",115.8513803141,-31.9243925053
"North Perth","Loftus St, Mount Hawthorn","Tight curves or blind crests",2,"nearly taken out daily by cars driving over two lanes to go through that dogleg type road",115.846222043,-31.9247662868
"North Perth","56, Menora","Confusing layout",9,"Whoever designed this merging lane after coming through a major intersection needs their qualifications (if any) revoked. Incredibly dangerous road layout with very poor signage and nowhere to go if the guy next to you doesn't realise that the lanes merge. It is seriously a nightmare. I try to avoid it at all costs but maybe that was the idea. It must be a nightmare to live in the area with horns going and tyres squealing every day.",115.8596894145,-31.9241220332
"North Perth","391-391 Fitzgerald St, North Perth","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"Too busy and too narrow for cyclists and cars to share this section of road.  Puts everyone at risk!",115.8589786291,-31.9325629915
"North Perth","Vincent St, North Perth","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",2,"It would be better to have a propper crosswalk where cars have to stop for the pedestrian.  It is often a long time when it is safe to cross both sides.  We have to walk to the middle of the road and wait for the next break in traffic in order to cross the other side of the road.  Many people use Beatty Park Aquatic Centre and quite often walk there.",115.8489847183,-31.9363757377

"North Perth","75 & Charles St, Joondanna","Confusing layout",1,"I have seen many vehicles go straight from the left lane traveling east along green/Walcott, causing near accidents with vehicles turning left from wanneroo rd onto walcott, or preventing vehicles needing to turn into driveways on the left or taking the first lane from moving to the left lane once through the intersection. ",115.8473968506,-31.913774656
"North Perth","154-168 Chelmsford Rd, North Perth","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Frequent heavy traffic and often speeding vehicles makes this a dangerous, difficult section to cross. Many school children walking and riding to school on such a main, busy road is worrying. Cars cannot easily time crossing most of the time. A roundabout and or crossing options need to be implemented. ",115.8585506719,-31.9355957286
"North Perth","Fitzgerald St & Grosvenor Rd, North Perth","Other",0,"Many vehicles cross Fitzgerald St at Grosvenor Rd (or Raglan Rd, Chelmsford Rd etc) at peak hours. Traffic is heavy travelling into or out of the city. Cars use the Bus lane as a means of overtaking traffic lines in order to avoid delays or pure impatience. It makes for very dangerous road use crossing Fitzgerald St when vehicle in the non bus lane leave a gap for crossing cars and impatient cars speed down the Bus Lane. There are hundreds of cars doing this every peak hour.",115.8587613702,-31.9347618841
