"Girrawheen","81 & Girrawheen Ave, Girrawheen","Vegetation/objects block visibility",0,"I was involved in an accident at this intersection, it was nearing sunset and the position of the sun made it difficult to see traffic travelling east, which lane they were in or if they were indicating to turn. I have seen several other accidents at this intersection and believe that a roundabout or lights would help here.",115.8403372765,-31.8346636093
"Girrawheen","81 & Girrawheen Ave, Girrawheen","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"   I've lived here for 43 years and the problem just continues to get worse. This junction needs traffic lights. It's the feeder road for the High School, also a local primary school, library and shopping centre, When pulling out from Girrawheen Ave., vision is hampered by the curve of the road. The number of vehicles using this junction during school drop off pick up times turns the experience into Russian Roulette... I'm amazed there aren't more accidents there.",115.8402729034,-31.8349097123
"Girrawheen","60 & Templeton Cres, Girrawheen","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",1,"I live in Girrawheen and have to exit Templeton Ave onto Wanneroo Rd on a daily basis. During weekday mornings, it is very difficult. The cars already along Wanneroo Rd slow down around this point due to the traffic lights at Wanneroo/Beach Rd. This is due to the number of cars travelling along here southbound at the that peak time. It has forced me to go the long way by instead taking Blackmore Ave to Beach Rd. However I am damaging my car in the process due to speed jumps along Templeton.",115.8226709071,-31.8386698633
