"Marmion","Hasper Pl & Rountree Way, Marmion","Poor road markings or no edge-lines",0,"Many drivers come out onto Rountree Way from Hasper Place, Marmion without looking. Hasper Place is downhill. A 'Give Way' sign or Stop sign is needed at this intersection. I am aware of the danger of this intersection and always approach it when travelling along Rountree Way, but often cars come out in front of me. I have had several near misses. These include children on bicycles or skateboards. Someone will get killed at this intersection if they haven't already. It is a popular thoroughfare.",115.7579612732,-31.8399410071
