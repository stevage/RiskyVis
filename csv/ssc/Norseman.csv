"Norseman","94, Norseman","Lacks overtaking opportunities",2,"The road has heavy use from trucks, road trains, caravans and cars. I have seen trucks overtaking caravans that are slow moving when they are approaching bends and cannot see oncoming traffic. People that are towing caravans seem to go slower than normal. I think our main roads should be duel lane like NSW and VIC",121.6652584076,-32.0054921569
