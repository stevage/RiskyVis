"North Lake","Farrington Rd, Murdoch","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"When cycling early mornings there is no lighting and very little room for cars and especially trucks to overtake bikes. The shrubs on the side of the road often extend into the shoulder/cycle (loosely used term) lane forcing cyclists to move onto the single lane road and often in front of the path of fast moving vehicles that may not have seen you due to the frequent bends on the road. Further on near the freeway you need to cycle down the middle of the road to stay on Farrington. Very dangerous",115.8307242393,-32.0767565403
"North Lake","135-135 Progress Dr, North Lake","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",2,"When approaching Farrington Rd from Progress Dv, there is a chicane that allows only one vehicle at a time to travel north/south on Progress Dv. This is very dangerous if a vehicle travels north thru the chicane and then attempts to turn right into the North Lake carpark as the right turn can be blocked by a vehicle travelling south in Progress  that has to give way to north bound traffic. Car turning into the c/park risks being rear ended by another car northbound behind it.",115.8206605911,-32.0760474439

"North Lake","Allendale Ent, North Lake","Area requires lights/roundabout",1,"All members of our household use the intersection most days, often several times during a day as this I the only entrance and exit to our estate. The roundabout needs to be replaced with traffic lights, or at least add them to protect cars entering from Allendale Entrance. We often have to take risks to join the roundabout. Major road upgrades in the area may do little to address the problem, the lights could be added as part of the current works. ",115.8424723148,-32.0799292248
