"Yallingup","Caves Rd & Wildwood Rd, Yallingup","Speed limit too high",3,"This intersection is high use, due a school being located on the corner. When entering Caves Rd from Wildwood Rd to head north, there is a corner (looking south) on Caves Rd that is very close to the intersection, that provides very little time for cars entering the intersection to come up to speed before north bound vehicles on Caves Rd, doing 80km/hr, reach the intersection. The speed limit needs to be decreased to 60km/hr on Caves Rd for a distance either side of the intersection.  ",115.0309324265,-33.6729256663
