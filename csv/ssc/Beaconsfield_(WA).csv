"Beaconsfield (WA)","Douro Rd & Hampton Rd, South Fremantle","Confusing layout",0,"Driving south on Hampton Rd, the bus lane is marked by a unbroken yellow line which ends at Douro Rd intersection. That would make it illegal to be in the bus lane (unless turning left but there is no left turn possible as is T junction). MANY vehicles sneak into the left (Bus) lane before the intersection to get the 'jump' on traffic correctly using the one available lane. I  turn left into a business just after the intersection but can't move left due to them. A moped rider was killed there.",115.7591199875,-32.0730746337

There needs to be some restrictions on speed and access to Mardie St. from South St. to ensure safety for road users and pedestrians.",115.762078464,-32.0637896615
