"Beeliar","Beeliar Dr, Beeliar","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Travelling Westbound on Beeliar at peak hour offers little chance for navigating as a cyclist - even on the cycle path. Cars are too busy looking right to yield to heaver traffic and all too eager to proceed when they get a chance, not seeing the pedestrian/cyclist at their left. Similarly, the roundabout being at the crest of a hill stymies accelleration by non motorised traffic when it can proceed frustrating the majority of motor vehicles.",115.8113694191,-32.1285784045
