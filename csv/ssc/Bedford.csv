"Bedford","Beaufort St, Bedford","Other",0,"As people head north towards Grand Prom lights, if the lights to turn right are red, people turn right at Rosebery and use the side street as a thoroughfare to Railway Parade.  My suggestion is to have a No right turn at Rosebery (remove the no right turn at Salisbury Street nearby)  Alternatively I would suggest installing chicane in an effort to slow the traffic heading east over the hill on Rosebery as it is dangerous at high speed",115.8923614025,-31.9164065745
"Bedford","Broun Ave & Coode St, Bedford","Other",0,"Three of the four approaches to this intersection are on a downward gradient meaning that it is more difficult to reduce speed as vehicles approach the intersection. The remaining approach is on an s-shaped bend. Three or the four approaches have limited sideways visibility due to property boundary fences.  No dedicated turning lanes. Three schools in close proximity with heavy traffic on school days in morning and afternoon.  There is little room for 'escape' in an emergency situation.",115.8999118209,-31.9086153308
"Bedford","199-225 The Strand, Bedford","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"I cycle down The Strand, it is very narrow, so the car are very close or invading the bicycle lanes. When I can I pull out of the road, because I am scared that if the driver, eats, drinks or text , he will run over me. Why not to put at least the acoustic signals on the road strips? It should have been better to make only one lane for the bicycles, but separated from the road. Thank you!",115.886964798,-31.9036834195

Parents  blocking way to turn right and ignoring turning car.",115.8914923668,-31.9091116951
"Bedford","53, Bedford","Inadequate rest or stopping areas",0,"Crossing here can be quite tricky. With the poor viability due to the blind crest you cant really see if there are any oncoming cars until after you have started crossing over. Coupled with the fact that often a lane can be reserved for buses on either side I hate crossing over here.",115.8910417557,-31.9173263622
