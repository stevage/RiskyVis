"Wandi","Liddelow Rd & Rowley Rd, Banjup","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"When heading north from De Haer Rd to Liddelow Rd, there is a dog-leg on Rowley Rd. You have to enter left onto Rowley Rd then stop and turn right onto Liddelow Rd. This causes a problem for traffic heading west on Rowley Rd. They have to slow/stop to allow you to turn - there is no room for them to get around you. The road needs to be widened at this point to create a turning lane. Otherwise dangerous!!",115.8889389038,-32.1804434958
