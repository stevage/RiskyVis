"Bridgetown","15-15 Whittells Rd, Bridgetown","Hazardous roadside objects or trees",0,"Lots of people walking especially school kids from the bus stop, there is no verge to walk on so they have to walk on the road, the road is narrow so 2 cars and a walker can�۪t all safely fit! Huge trees line road and it�۪s bendy and visability is very poor! The road is used as a shortcut to get from one side of town across to the other so it�۪s quite busy and cars do not travel at 60kms - it�۪s used as a rally track because of the bends",116.1484587193,-33.9432086374
