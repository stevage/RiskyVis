If I want to settle to 100kph before the end of the slip road to merge smoothly, I have to start accelerating significantly before the 100kph sign (illegal, and police sometimes positioned at that jct to help enforce that).  If I accelerate as I pass 100kph sign then even flooring it I can't get to 100kph so am joining the freeway while still speeding up making judging the merge hard for me and oncoming traffic.",115.8358955383,-31.9331480022
