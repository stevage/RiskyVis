"Harrisdale","130-132 Wright Rd, Harrisdale","Tight curves or blind crests",8,"It is very dangerous to try to cross the road. Cars go too fast. You can�۪t see past the bus stop when a bus is there.  Trees bushes obscure the view. The road is bendy so vision is limited. You can�۪t stop in the middle.  Many families cross here taking children to school.  It is an accident waiting to happen. I submitted a petition to council of over 100 signatures about 4 years ago.  They lost it apart from the first page and nothing has happened to make it safer",115.9330022335,-32.114385301

"Harrisdale","13, Harrisdale","Poor or confusing signage",0,"For drivers that are unaware, there is no warning that the new left hand lane/bus lane does not continue to Nicholson Road but ends at Livingston Shopping centre; so if turning left can be caught out. Vehicles use Bus Lane during bus lane only times to beat the queues and push in when lane ends - forcing cars to let them in.
