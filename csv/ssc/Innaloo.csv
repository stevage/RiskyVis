"Innaloo","De Grey St & Dongara St, Innaloo","Confusing layout",2,"There is a flat roundabout at the intersection which is an odd shape. It is very confusing as to what you are meant to do and most cars simply drive over it which makes giving way difficult.",115.7990795374,-31.8984620453
"Innaloo","Beatrice St & Shaw Rd, Innaloo","Confusing layout",0,"The road reduces to one lane between Thor St and Beatrice St but there are no signs to indicate who is allowed to drive on this section of road. I have even seen police cars get caught here with one car having to reverse to free up space on the road.",115.7940369844,-31.8941353443
"Innaloo","47-53 Oswald St, Innaloo","Other",0,"There is a pinch point located right before the roundabout. Cars get confused because people coming off the roundabout need to enter the pinch point at the same time that people entering need to. It is very difficult to keep track of everything here.",115.8000773191,-31.8993911209
"Innaloo","King George St & Odin Rd, Innaloo","Area requires lights/roundabout",0,"There is so much traffic trying to turn between King George St and Odin Rd that motorists often perform risky manouvers. It is compounded by the recent closure of the Odin Rd entrance onto Beatrice St. There is also a pedestrian crossing on Odin Rd which requires people to monitor traffic on both roads. I have almost been hit by cars as a pedestrain several times here.",115.7959038019,-31.8974145469
"Innaloo","1-15 Drysdale St, Innaloo","Confusing layout",0,"There are several sections of the road where it reduces to one lane. Not clear who has right of way in these circumstances.",115.7977437973,-31.8984233336
"Innaloo","25-33 Dongara St, Innaloo","Confusing layout",0,"The road contains several combinations of traffic slowing devices, including pinch points and lane narrowers. It does not slow down the traffic but actually increases speed as motorists are frustrated at not being able to drive in a straight line.",115.7992458344,-31.8972483123
"Innaloo","King George St & Thor St, Innaloo","Poor or no median strip",0,"Cars turning right from King George St onto Thor St often cut the corner, even when there is a car present. Recent introduction of painted line has not solved the issue.",115.7946646214,-31.897366726
"Innaloo","Boronia St & Phillips Grv, Innaloo","Other",0,"Cars travelling on Phillips Grove frequently ignore the stop sign posted at the intersection. There are also numerous cars parked on Boronia St which makes it difficult to see oncoming traffic.",115.7914942503,-31.8962850569
"Innaloo","64, Innaloo","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Cars want to turn right into the far lane of Scarborough Beach Road. There are too many cars on Scarborough Beach road for this to be safe and often the road is blocked up by people attempting it. It should be made illegal to do this from here,",115.7978403568,-31.9023877812
"Innaloo","64 & Liege St, Innaloo","Poorly timed traffic light system",0,"The lights do not stay green long enough for cars turning right from Scarborough Beach Road onto Leige Street. Several cars go through the red light each cycle.",115.7984143496,-31.9026929068

"Innaloo","64, Innaloo","Poorly timed traffic light system",2,"With the traffic for Ikea and the shopping centre traffic there needs to be more lanes, for the motorist turning right at the lights onto Cedric Street. ",115.8026683331,-31.8938597948
"Innaloo","64 & Ellen Stirling Blvd, Innaloo","Other",1,"There is a long line of traffic that turns left onto Scarb Bch Rd via a cutaway. Some vehicles continue in this lane to turn right onto Scarb Bch Rd then left into Liege st. Sometimes the cars in the right lane want to turn left at Liege st too so need to merge quickly.",115.8002865314,-31.9030549575

"Innaloo","Ellen Stirling Blvd, Innaloo","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Despite the yellow markings in the intersection through traffic still blocks the way.  One day in a bus, we waited for 13 changes of lights in the afternoon, to turn right into Scarborough Beach Road.",115.8002838492,-31.9030526805
"Innaloo","64 & Odin Rd, Innaloo","Other",1,"The arrangement to exit the Bunnings carpark creates danger and frustration, largely because the bulk of drivers ignore existing signage. The bulk of drivers continue to exit left on to Odin Road (then wanting to go right into Scarborough Beach Road or straight to Ewen Street) via the lane intended to help drivers turn right into Odin Road. This causes traffic to build up in the carpark, is a more dangerous location to make this turn left and makes it a challenge for those wanting to go right.",115.7960700989,-31.9010966789
"Innaloo","Hertha Rd & Odin Rd, Innaloo","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",2,"Vehicles traveling East on Barnes Road ( to turn right into Odin) approach the roundabout too fast and expect no traffic heading north on Odin Rd, creating near misses. Further, cars heading South on Odin Rd often have to wait for 30 or so cars coming down Barnes ( at speed) before a chance may present to get through the roundabout. As a result the queue on Odin often extends past Birralee Loop.  A speed hump on Barnes to slow vehicles would addressthis issue. ",115.79791545870005,-31.8903117376
"Innaloo","Morris Rd & Stoner St, Innaloo","Confusing layout",1,"The creation of a ""main"" thoroughfare between Stoner and Ambrose Streets and placing ""Give Way"" and street markings on the diagonal immediately over the crest of a hill on the clearly most common route from Beatrice Street to Barnes Street defies common driving logic and practice. Since this was altered I have narrowly avoided a collision from the right driving out of Stoner Street into Morris Road.",115.791285038,-31.8913911996
"Innaloo","10-22 La Grange St, Innaloo","Other",0,"The street and the continuing Windell st have many plants on the street (at sides as well as in the middle), and they are not fenced or kerbed up. I supposed they wanted to make slow down points but they never finish them, making them confusing",115.7969927788,-31.8952671378
