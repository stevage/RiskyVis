Consequently vehicles bank up going up the hill with no opportunity to overtake for at least 5 - 10kms. Poor design. To use the overtaking lane you pretty much have to speed up prior to the open speed limit of 110km and the remainder of the overtaking lane is extremely short in length to overtake at 110km.",117.655017972,-34.5975846584
