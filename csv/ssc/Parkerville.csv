"Parkerville","3645-3905 Richardson Rd, Parkerville","Speed limit too high",0,"Highly restricted visibility due to hill crest for vehicles entering Richardson Road from Schoch road and no pedestrian or cyclist paths. Therefore speed limit is too high at 80 kph. I recommend moving the 50kms speed sign to the east westward to cater for this issue and the expanding residential suburb to the east of this area. Move the sign please to make it safe! One death in recent years at this point!",116.154268384,-31.8757013199
