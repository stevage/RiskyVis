"Tuart Hill","French St & Riley St, Tuart Hill","Poor or confusing signage",0,"Seen a number of accidents and near misses here. There are 3 consecutive stop signs (French & Lawley, French & Riley, French & Cape). For French & Riley, trees hide the stop sign and drivers go straight through. School drivers are also using Riley Street to get to Tuart Hill Primary as an alternative route to Cape Street and often over speed limit. Dangerous intersection, which should be a roundabout. Otherwise only a matter of time before something more serious occurs.",115.8369657397,-31.9013448816

"Tuart Hill","60 & Cape St, Tuart Hill","Poorly timed traffic light system",1,"Cars turning right from Cape Street onto Wanneroo Road have to go through an orange and often red light to get across because they don't have the chance to turn earlier. 2 causes of this. 1. because the lights turn red too quickly 2. too much traffic coming down Cape Street and crossing Wanneroo Road so the turning cars don't get the chance. This in conjunction with cars coming down Cape Street (heading west) turning right onto Wanneroo Road (to go North), and it is very dangerous.",115.8427834511,-31.9022534346
