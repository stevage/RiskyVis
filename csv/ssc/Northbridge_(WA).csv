"Northbridge (WA)","8, Northbridge","Poor or confusing signage",2,"On Graham Farmer Freeway, when nearing the turnoff to get to the Freeway South, the signage is very confusing. I have seen a number of drivers confused and due to the signage, mistakenly think the turnoff for Freeway South is actually the turnoff for Loftus Street and then try to cross traffic to get to it as otherwise it's a big detour to get to the Freeway Sth. I myself have missed the turnoff once or twice when not paying attention. V hazardous, could be corrected by signage ",115.8532440662,-31.9436047255
"Northbridge (WA)","Aberdeen St & William St, Northbridge","Poorly timed traffic light system",0,"The walk light across William Street is green at the same time as the West Bound traffic on Aberdeen Street.  The West Bound traffic turning South on to William is directed green to go, but people are crossing at the same time.  You have to take care to remember this and not turn South onto William Street unless you are sure there are no pedestrians crossing.  Both their green light and Aberdeen green light stay on together creating confusion and a potential hazard / accident.  ",115.8604216576,-31.9472827328
