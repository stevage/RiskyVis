Much of the vegetation has volatile oils in its leaves and is highly flammable. Dry grass, large belts of Tea tree, eucalypts with dry litter at their base will support fire. On this Highway and similarly for the Kwinana Freeway with its restricted access and egress motorists can become trapped when a fire breaks out.
