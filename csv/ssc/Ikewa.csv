"Ikewa","592-592 Coalseam Rd, Ikewa","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"This is a single sealed lane road, that is used by a school bus to transport children to school. It is also a major route for the transport of grain from farms to the Mingenew CBH site and as a consequence it is used by two trailer road trains and some longer vehicles illegelly using it. It is un policed so there is no curtailing these operations.",115.4918003082,-29.1511118598
"Ikewa","1017-1017 Mingenew-Morawa Rd, Ikewa","Poor road surface quality",0,"While the Morawa end of this road is in reasonable to good condition, starting from the Mingenew end, the bitumen strip added to widen the road has seriously subsided resulting in a dangerous lip that drags your vehicle if you are not paying attention. This goes on for about 20 kilometres & is made worse by a series of quite sharp bends. It deteriorates again where the roadbed becomes seriously rough 10km & a series of sharp bends are made even more dangerous by an extremely wavy road surface. ",115.4808112979,-29.1676296661
