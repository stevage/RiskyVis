"Embleton","53 & Collier Rd, Embleton","Other",0,"Travelling down Collier Road towards Morley and attempting to turn right at Broun Avenue (heading East) can be a nightmare . Visibility is poor as there are 3 oncoming lanes of traffic - the two turning lanes block visibility of the third lane of traffic coming straight ahead. There are many near misses as drivers take risks by continuing to turn even if they can't see if a car is coming. I have experienced impatient aggressive drivers behind me honking their horns but I won't go if I can't see!",115.9048390388,-31.9011148956
