"Wubin","498-498 Syme Rd, Wubin","Other",0,"Manuel road carries the most traffic, vehicles including loaded grain trucks travelling South have a short section of visibility after coming over a hill. Syme road is much less used, the angle of the intersection would allow Syme road to be aligned at right angles to Manuel road in both directions creating a stop situation for Syme road traffic. There is space for this, half a day with a grader would do it. I suggested this to our past Shire Councillor some time ago.",116.6728815436,-30.0569484801
