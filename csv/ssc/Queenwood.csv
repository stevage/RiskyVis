This highway carries a high traffic of road trains, I�۪ve lived in this area for 22 years and multiple times I have pulled out of this intersection thinking it is safe only to see a road train coming around the corner a couple of seconds later at 100km/h and having to pull over on the side of the road to let it go past.
