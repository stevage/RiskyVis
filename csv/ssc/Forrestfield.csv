"Forrestfield","Hale Rd & Woolworths Dr, Forrestfield","Area requires lights/roundabout",7,"The traffic along Hale Road is very busy as is the traffic coming off Woolworth's Drive (from the shopping center). It is incredibly dangerous trying to turn right from Woolworth's Drive onto Hale Road. Many accidents have happened at this intersection.",116.008297205,-31.9892643952
"Forrestfield","4, Forrestfield","Other",0,"Southbound traffic from Roe Highway off ramp has to stay in it's lane.  There are prominent double white lines, which are ignored by many who weave dangerously across the lanes. ",115.9909486771,-31.9935183755
"Forrestfield","230 Hale Rd, Forrestfield","Other",0,"The section of Hale Rd between Reynolds Road and Tonkin Hwy westbound should be two lanes. During peak hour, motorists actually create two lanes recognising that traffic flows much quicker when that happens. Unfortunately, outside of peak hour some drivers 'assume' that arrangement which can surprise other motorists. It has created near misses and road rage incidents that I have seen.",115.9943819046,-31.9947376619

"Forrestfield","4, Forrestfield","Poor or confusing signage",1,"The lack of proper overhead signage and lane guidance along Tonkin Hwy south from Horrie Miller Drive is pathetic and dangerous.  To exit to Roe Hwy north, one needs to keep moving into the left-hand lane at the first opportunity, but there is absolutely no guidance provided by signage to do this.  All of a sudden, at the exit, there is a sign on the left-hand verge, but too late if you are in one of the other lanes. Would not be tolerated in the eastern states or overseas.",115.9832561016,-31.9843231608

"Forrestfield","4, Forrestfield","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"No shared path from Mills Road to Hale Road. Cyclists must use ���cycle lanes�۝ on the shoulder putting them in close proximity to high speed traffic and trucks, as well as tyre busting debris like glass or metals. Some drivers also illegally use the shoulders to get around traffic congestion at peak times. This section of road is a huge gap in what would otherwise be a well connected off road bicycle network in Perth.",115.9978312254,-32.0029492239
"Forrestfield","Berkshire Rd, Forrestfield","Poorly timed traffic light system",0,"Traffic lights only have 6 second interval not enough time for trucks to pull away and people try to run the lights, I have encountered cars on the wrong side of the road as the whole junction is accident waiting to happen!
