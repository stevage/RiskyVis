"Merredin","Barrack St, Merredin","Vegetation/objects block visibility",0,"I reported this by telephone to the Merredin Shire Office several years ago. Each time I enter the roundabout from Barrack Street to turn right into Mary Street I feel an element of risk, especially as my 1996 Mitsubishi Mirage is a low vehicle, and when another vehicle, especially if a low vehicle in Mary Street is coming from the right I dont see it until the last moment. I have spoken about this to a local resident who said she will not use this roundabout because of the poor visibility.",118.2826790214,-31.4819243873
