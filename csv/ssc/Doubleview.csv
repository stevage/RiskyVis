You have a reasonably busy road running east-west, meaning drivers are impacted by sunrise/set at main times of use, with a crest at top of the hill leading to a funny-angled bend with poor visibility, and making it all worse - at a location where there is an adjoining primary - and soon to be a second school on the site! MASSIVE safety issue for young children !!",115.7764685154,-31.8972984104
