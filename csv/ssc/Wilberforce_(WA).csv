"Wilberforce (WA)","120 & Karabine Rd, Wilberforce","Confusing layout",0,"When your travelling along Great Eastern Highway to get to the off ramp to go to Goomalling Road you can hardly see the road as poorly disigned, also at night the stupid lights that are there are bad as it is hard to see where the road is to turn right to the off ramp and you can see where drivers have hit the island and curbing. It all needs to be redesigned better with better lighting clearer markings on the road and wider off ramp road. I hate driving at night to it.",116.76269531249999,-31.76320220990002
