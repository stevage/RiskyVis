"Mount Richon","Bedfordale Hill Rd & South Western Hwy, Mount Richon","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",0,"Semi trailers and B doubles that are traveling either North or South bound along the South Western Hwy rarely stop at the red lights and many times we have almost been taken out while in the middle of the intersection (coming down from Bedfordale Hill Rd) on a green light and had to suddenly brake for trucks not stopping at these red lights and just continuing on through. I HIGHLY recommend a red light/speed camera on this intersection before someone is either seriously injury of even killed.",116.0176473856,-32.1588767434
