"Yokine","Cape St & Flinders St, Yokine","Other",5,"Visibility for vehicles turning onto Flinders from Cape is very poor and it can be very congested, especially as peak hour, with cars waiting at/slowing down for the traffic lights which are a short distance away on Flinders/Blythe. Also, vehicles turning right from Flinders onto Cape have to cross two lanes and during peak hour it can be really difficult to see if cars are approaching in the far lane. I have seen lots of near misses and dangerous driver behaviour at this intersection.",115.8492207527,-31.9023536253
"Yokine","Flinders St & Swanston St, Yokine","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Right Turn from Swanston St onto Flinders st - you have to wait awhile, as there is always traffic coming from both directions. its hard to pick your gap to cross through to turn as on your drivers side, there is a little dip and on the passengers side there is a bend. I've had so many near misses at this intersection. and also you have traffic coming from behind you to turn left and they cant see either and they 'wing it'.",115.8493709564,-31.9081257947
"Yokine","76 & Constance St, Yokine","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",1,"Drivers pulling out from stop sign in Constance street to go straight across our turn right onto Morley drive and blocking traffic travelling along or turning from Morley drive. I believe this intersection should be blocked to stop this practice. This is also used as a short cut to avoid having to go through the lights at Morley drive and Wanneroo road",115.8404767513,-31.8891366128

"Yokine","407-413 Hector St, Yokine","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",0,"The road is wide and straight and has a steep slope running uphill when eastbound. This leads to cars using the street as a drag race strip. Our children who play on front gardens are at severe risk and the rise of the hill has also had multiple crashes (although City of Stirling statistics have allocated those crashes to Latrobe St which is wrong) as it's a blind rise that also has the rising sun in direct eye line in the mornings.",115.85086762910004,-31.904250397800002
