"Ruabon","10, Ruabon","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",3,"Bussell Hwy between Capel and Busselton I have seen a lot of drivers sitting 20kms under the speed limit, sometimes more, and little opportunity to overtake. Narrow and bumpy surfaces. This should be dual carriageway both ways all the way.  Drivers get impatient with slow incompetent drivers so push to overtake  (even if not meant to sometimes, I have seen this) and many have caused accidents and many near misses. It is a very busy section of road and only getting busier. How many more must die?",115.4483511844,-33.640730381

With hundreds of people using is daily and it being the main entry in and out of Busselton it needs immediate attention. Drivers are scared to use this road but unfortunately it is unavoidable. There is minimal overtaking opportunities and for the most part runs as a single carriage way when it should at least be dual, given that it is a busy regional main road.
