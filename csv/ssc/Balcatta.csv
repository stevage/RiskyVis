"Balcatta","10-24 Beryl St, Balcatta","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",0,"Although speed-bumps are in place, because of the type of speed-bump they have little to no effect on most vehicles. Bumps need to be replaced to be full width and larger as it is not uncommon for vehicles to hoon through here at 70km/h on a quite residential street.",115.8218193054,-31.8775120898

"Balcatta","3, Balcatta","Other",0,"The speed limit here is too low.  The road is of freeway standard with a 70 kph limit and is fed by one road with a 90 kph limit and another with a 100 kph limit.  This results in tailgating and frustrations from drivers driving to the conditions conflicting with drivers driving to the limit.  Regular police presence in the form of speed traps then causes sudden braking creating further risks.",115.8067131042,-31.8562725947
"Balcatta","2-8 Sylvia St, Balcatta","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"This intersection is very scary. Coming across from one side can be difficult as there is a bus stop close to the corner and a light pole, if anyone is speeding down Main St, you often experience a near miss. From the opposite direction, when vehicles park on the verge the view is blocked somewhat. ",115.8289234418,-31.8813256735

"Balcatta","77, Stirling","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",1,"I live on Odin Drive Stirling and unfortunately need to access the right hand turn from Boya Way on Erindale Road. Over the years I have witnessed long waiting queues on Boya Way and numerous near misses.  There is little opportunity to cross this intersection safely and it should be given high priority for either traffic lights or a roundabout.  This has gone on way too long with no one taking action.  I hope that we can see sense to make it a priority before a fatality occurs.",115.8053383883,-31.8670065662
