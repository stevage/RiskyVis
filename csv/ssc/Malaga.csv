"Malaga","3 & Reid Hwy, Malaga","Confusing layout",8,"Several near miss",115.9164690971,-31.8671708621
"Malaga","1 & Lennard St, Herne Hill","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"This is at Beach Road and Marmion intersection. There have been a few accidents here over the years. Poorly designed. Needs road redesigning and/or traffic lights. In peak hours not enough space for cars turning eastbound from Marmion northbound. Where Marmion meets Beach Rd on the west side, is the area for several accidents. Not easy to turn at and accidents occur with impatient drivers waiting for what they think is to long a time.",115.908164978,-31.8600634426

"Malaga","Beringarra Ave & Malaga Dr, Malaga","Area requires lights/roundabout",1,"It is a wait turning left/south onto Malaga Dr from Beringarra Ave and almost impossible to turn right/north into Malaga Drive. Also there is no give way for southbound Malaga Dr vehicles turning left into Beringarra which seems to confuse Northbound motorists turning right into Beringarra (they forget they have to give way to them in the current layout). I would highly recommend a roundabout here rather than another set of lights.",115.8950972557,-31.8640956036

"Malaga","3, Malaga","Confusing layout",4,"The new intersection is terrible. Traffic queues for km on Reid Highway making it difficult to turn left at the roundabout. As a result drivers mount kerb and run along closed lane or hard shoulder.  Coming the Tonkin highway north and wanting to turn right to Reid you have to wait on a break and cut across multiple lanes onto and then swing left while traffic heading east on Reid don't want to give way and let you in. THE worst new bit of road I have ever had the displeasure of driving.",115.9130305052,-31.8650614736

"Malaga","Marshall Rd, Malaga","Other",0,"About 100 metres before the Beringarra Ave intersection, travelling towards Whiteman Park, the kerbing on the left side of the dual carriageway juts out into the lane, at a drain inlet, and presents a rollover hazard if a tyre hit it. It needs to be made completely parallel with the lane, using ridges if need be in the lane surface to direct water into the drain.",115.9118852019,-31.857076796
