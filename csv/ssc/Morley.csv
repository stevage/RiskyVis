"Morley","Russell St & Walter Rd W, Morley","Other",2,"Without a turning arrrow - Cars turning right into Russell St from the Coventry direction of Walter Rd W have little visibility past the cars turning from the opposite direction causing many people to take risks by pulling into oncoming lanes before visibility is possible.

There have recently been chevron signs erected (only on the southern direction of the road) to indicate a tight bend, but other safety systems need to be installed, such as crash barriers, rumble strips on the southbound approach to the traffic lights, better lighting on both lanes, especially southbound ",115.9250843525,-31.8875150981
