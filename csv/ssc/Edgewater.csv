"Edgewater","2, Edgewater","Other",1,"This section of the freeway is a nightmare. The traffic often slows to less than 40km or comes to a standstill outside of peak times & on the weekend. The merge points at the Ocean Reef and Whitfords on-ramps are a major cause of the traffic delays. I feel that the curve of the road near Currambine station & lack of visibility ahead caused by guard rails & the station add to the congestion. The road surface is well overdue to be refinished. Widen this section of the freeway to address all points",115.7791239023,-31.7723191882
