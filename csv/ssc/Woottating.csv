"Woottating","Great Southern Hwy, Woottating","Poor road surface quality",2,"I drive this road twice daily and I have seen numerous accidents on the great southern highway. At the Yarra Road intersection an overtaking lane heading north approaches a blind corner - I witnessed a Ute ���aquaplane�۝ before flipping over the bonet landing back on the wheels. It is a narrow, winding road with no emergency lane & a very poorly maintained surface. Its a very busy road, especially with the trucks. The 80km speed limit entering York is far too high & needs to be reduced to 60km.",116.4555931091,-31.8822222027

"Woottating","Great Southern Hwy, Inkpen","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"Very narrow road, the only parts where it is acceptable is at the passing lanes, desperately needs to be widened. As a former linemarker (who also now travels this road often to go home), this was one of the worst roads we had to paint - lack of visibility due to bends, a lot of semi trucks on a narrow road, and the new ""signage"" added in the 2017 is more distracting than helpful - blinding at night. Quairading - York Rd was upgraded and widened, I would like to see similar changes made here. ",116.549498064,-31.8865128018
