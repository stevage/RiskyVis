"Churchlands","11-33 Alumni Ter, Churchlands","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",1,"The road is used as a short cut between Empire Ave and Pearson St. Cars almost always travel at the same speed as on those main roads. The street is a small local street and is alongside a park and close to many schools, I have seen many many times families try to cross the road only to have a speeding car approach before they expect. It�۪s only a matter of time before someone gets injured. The street is also frequented by many heavy vehicles (trucks, semi-trailers) as there is no other quick way",115.7920575142,-31.9240469079
"Churchlands","1-5 Flynn St, Churchlands","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"The Herdsman sees quite a bit of vehicle traffic.  Combined with structure of the entrance, the lack of parking and the general street structure makes for a risky location.  The media strip needs to be closed, and a roundabout installed West of the shops in order to allow people to enter and exit only while traveling west (and then use the roundabouts to get access to the shops.  Traffic comes from too many directions.",115.8018636703,-31.9310993102
