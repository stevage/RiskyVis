"Myalup","1 & Myalup Beach Rd, Myalup","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",1,"Tragic volume on Forrest Highway is now significant and many long loads use the Highway and travel at speed limit. Dual carriage way utilised by all vehicles and the lack of turning lane onto the highway means exiting from Myalup at drivers peril until a speed of 110 km can be reached and thus travel with the traffic heading back to Perth.
