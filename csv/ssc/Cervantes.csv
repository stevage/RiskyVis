"Cervantes","60, Cervantes","Lacks overtaking opportunities",0,"drivers overtaking on or after overtaking lanes have or are about to come to an end is a major problem not only on this section of road but any major highway in WA. my personal experience that drivers have not been taught how to drive safely only how to pass a driving test. It is not the road where most of problem is, people need to drive to the conditions & environment. Don`t know why people refer to them as accidents, they are incidents where someone is to blame & it is not usually the road.",115.0860786438,-30.5102165872
