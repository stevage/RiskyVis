"Stratton","3 & 50, Stratton","Poorly timed traffic light system",0,"At certain times of the day the timing of the traffic lights to turn right onto Toodyay rd from Roe Hwy allows only 3-4 cars to pass through on green.  This results in a long line of cars in the turning right lane which becomes so full that cars have to wait on Roe Hwy itself in the 80km zone.  I feel too scared to wait for someone to drive into me at 80km/hr so I often choose to turn left, turn the car around and proceed safely through the intersection.",116.0272523761,-31.8678496832
"Stratton","50 & Lewis Jones Crss, Middle Swan","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Drivers coming out of Lewis jones cross onto Toodyay road (turning right) are waiting a long time due to traffic coming along Toodyay road in both directions. A round-about would fix this issue.",116.0330271721,-31.8650569177
"Stratton","Farrall Rd, Jane Brook","Poor road surface quality",0,"Farrall Rd in Stratton & Jane Brook is in very poor condition, as the road surface is covered by patched-up potholes & the bends in road are inadequately marked & poor lighting (some areas non-existence streetlights) makes it hard to see at night, especially when it rains. Additionally the road surface near the train-track area (Farrall Rd in Stratton past the shopping center) is also in poor condition & poorly lit-up at night.",116.0378980637,-31.861475858
