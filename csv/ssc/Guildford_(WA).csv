"Guildford (WA)","1 & Meadow St, Guildford","Other",1,"Level crossing at turn with no straight through traffic is crazy. Could easily fix by either removing the level crossing or allowing traffic to go straight on Meddow Street. So many accidents caused by this intersection.",115.9715723991,-31.8990745986
"Guildford (WA)","James St, Guildford","Other",1,"The road is congested and narrow for such a busy stretch of road. The most logical way to get from bayswater/bassendean to midland but they ha e congested the road too much",115.9662723541,-31.8993478553
"Guildford (WA)","1 & Meadow St, Guildford","Other",0,"Cars heading to turn right onto right onto James St from Meadow St continually park near or on rail crossing as the lanes only permit 2 cars or a long vehicle at the red light which causes other cars to stop in an unsafe area where trains travelling extremely fast continually use the rail line.Combined with other traffic coming from the side road Stirling St also adds confusion to the intersection.There are a fast amount of trees lining Meadow St which makes it difficult for signs to be erected.",115.9716716409,-31.8992522156
"Guildford (WA)","1-11 Water St, Guildford","Other",3,"Patrons of the Woodbridge Hotel park on both side of the road limiting vehicle access to a tight one lane in the middle - traffic coming from both directions are forced to stop and wait to allow traffic to pass through and wait for a gap to go is quite dangerous during peak periods and there is the risk of a head on crash if cars misjudge their timing to go .",115.9831809998,-31.897416824
"Guildford (WA)","51 & Johnson St, Guildford","Poorly timed traffic light system",4,"Constant long tail backs and people losing patience and taking risks when turning right. There needs to be a green arrow for this.",115.9687399864,-31.8993842895
"Guildford (WA)","James St, Guildford","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",1,"Non-stop stream of traffic due to closing off one lane completely through Guildford. Extremely difficult for Emergency Services vehicles to navigate in a hurry. Traffic jams created at traffic lights and bridge crossing due to limited number of crossings across river and bottle necking down to one lane. When an accident occurs that closes one bridge crossing access it creates total chaos. I suggest a new dual lane bridge across river to connect Morrison Rod Midland with Morley Drive Lockridge.",115.9683215618,-31.8993546867
"Guildford (WA)","1, Guildford","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"This bridge need to be two lanes each direction. This would reduce the traffic backing up when they come to merge be for entering the bridge",115.9686487913,-31.9063907664
