"Herdsman","75 & Frobisher St, Osborne Park","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Travelling from the  south on Frobisher to turn right onto Scarborough Beach Road is so dangerous. It is impossible to see if it is clear to turn right unless you get into the middle of the intersection.  I drive past this intersection everyday and I see so many near misses & have come across too many accidents being cleared by tow trucks.  There needs to be an arrow for turning right.  There are 3 others arrows at these lights so why not this side too.",115.8046102524,-31.9106417552
