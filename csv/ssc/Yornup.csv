"Yornup","26154-26154 South Western Hwy, Yornup","Lacks overtaking opportunities",0,"I drive the highway between Bridgetown and Manjimup every day for work. I see many near misses due to lack of safe overtaking practices. This stretch of road has a high volume of traffic including logging trucks, transport trucks, holiday makers, buses and general trafic. The volume has progressively increased over the last few years. If there were overtaking lanes, less risks would need to be taken.",116.2010192871,-34.1214685814
