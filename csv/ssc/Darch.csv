"Darch","Hartman Dr & Westport Pde, Darch","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",7,"As a resident exiting right onto Hartman from Westport parade is very risky and takes a long time especially at peak times close to school zones and lots of children and cyclists getting to school, 40 speed limit is frequently ignored.",115.8356970549,-31.8100454388
"Darch","Hartman Dr & Mullinger Way, Darch","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",125,"Very dangerous intersection especially when attempting to turn right on Hartman Drive off Mullingar.
