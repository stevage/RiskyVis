"Cloverdale","55 & Keane St, Cloverdale","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",1,"When turning right from Keane St into Abernethy Rd it is very hard to get across four lanes of traffic.  Often whilst waiting for a clear path, cars behind will shortcut through the Bowling Club and come out onto Abernethy Rd and turn right into Keane St in front of you, further delaying the ability to turn right.  A larger break area in the middle of the intersection would help so you could go halfway and wait for the other lanes to be free to enter safely. ",115.94288349150006,-31.96883799300001

The traffic signals in the center median of the lanes have no signal lights that can be seen from the other side of the intersection , the only lights on them are before the white stop here line .
