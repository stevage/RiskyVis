A lot of heavy vehicle traffic. No break in the traffic coming down Greenmount Hill ,only lights to break traffic is in Mundaring. Coming up Greenmount Hill only lights to break the traffic is Farrall Road lights. Drivers turning left and then doing uturn at Woolowra Rd to head east up Greenmount Hill because there is no break in the traffic. Drivers taking risks to turn right at Scott Street which is dangerous. I have seen many near misses&crashes .","PAMELA: None","None","None","None","Michelle: Hard to turn out of scott street when busy not much room on median strip and cars block visibility, high speed limit and impatience/hesitation/visibility causes a lot of crashes.","Lisa E: A very long queue forms in Scott Street to turn right into Great Eastern Highway. Queing for 3-5 minutes to turn left due to traffic congestion, and 5-10 minutes to turn right is frequent. Scott St needs a right hand turning lane to help flow the left hand turns, and definitely traffic lights are needed to cross the Great Eastern Highway.","Frank: hard to turn east from Scott street because of fast traffic coming down the hill. They obscure the view if vehicles turning left from Scott street on to the main road","Dave: Very hazardous junction with poor opportunities to turn right out of Scott Street.","None","Paul: People just do not stop at the stop sign,  they drive straight though . Lots of collisions.

Needs larger medium and larger turning right lanes from Great Eastern onto Scott street heading East.

Furthermore turning right into Great Eastern Highway from Scott Street is very dangerous and at times almost impossible. The driver is forced at times to turn left and and cross the up hill road then right into a side street, make a U Turn and enter Great Eastern Highway with a left turn. All very hazardous. ","Bernie: None","Todd: You have very little chance at most times  when busy to turn right out of Scott st to go up grt eastern hwy too much traffic to midland & too much traffic into scott st from midland . i saw a car turn right from scott , it stopped half way at median strip to wait for clear spot to continue , another vehicle followed it very shortly after & slammed into the back of it still under acceleration , very nearly pushing it out into oncoming. Turning right out of Scott needs to be stopped ,its suicide. ","John: None","K: None","Glenys: None","Julie: None","Peter: Cars turning right from Great Eastern  Highway into Scott Street very dangerous. Also cars turning right into Great Eastern Highway from Scott Street  very dangerous. Solution: Construct a Medium Strip In the Centre of the Great Eastern  Highway at this Intersection ","John: None","Ray: Generally the right turn from Scott St to Gt Eastern Hwy needs to be done in two stages ie cross the south/west bound carriage to the median and then enter the north/east bound carriage. On many occasions one has to stop within the median and wait for a traffic gap to enter the north/east bound carriage. The problem is that one is at an acute angle and cannot readily see the approaching traffic heading north/east. Drivers turning to or from Scott St also get impatient causing near misses.","John: When Travelling to midland from mundaring as i got close to scott st a woman driving a small sedan drove out of scott st right in front me causing me to brake hard as she had stalled the vechile in the middle of Gt eastern hwy i just stopped around 1/2 a metre away from  smashing into the side of her. if had been in my fourwheel drive i would had hit her.i count myself lucky i was in my accoured euro","Hazel: None","Jannette: This is terrible intersection, to many trucks that are going way to fast.
