"Donnybrook (WA)","Bendall Rd, Donnybrook","Other",0,"When turning from Bendall Road southward onto the Southwest Highway there is no entrance lane. The problem is southbound traffic on the SW Hwy are coming around a corner at 110kph and are not easily visible from Bendall Road. Without an entrance lane the entering traffic become a slow moving obstacle to the southbound traffic and a potential impact risk. The intersection is having much more traffic than it was originally designed for because of recent subdivisions.",115.7875809073,-33.5619104409
