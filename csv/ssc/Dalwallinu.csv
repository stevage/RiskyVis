"Dalwallinu","204-216 Locke Rd, Dalwallinu","Other",0,"I have travelled on Indian Ocean Road a number of times recently and note the amount of money being put into more passing lanes. Unfortunately, on each journey lately I've noticed that drivers, possibly oversea tourists, do not understand how to use them and completely block the lane. We love having tourists but I think we need to introduce a visitor permit, training scheme to prevent more of these fatal accidents and so many near misses.",116.6033935547,-30.268556249
