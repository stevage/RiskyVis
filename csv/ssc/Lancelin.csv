"Lancelin","1077-1077 Old Ledge Point Rd, Lancelin","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",0,"What is needed on Indian Ocean drive is a roadhouse at the Lancelin road turnoff as the road widens to two lanes both ways and has many high street lights and is also about half way to Jurien Bay. There are no fuel stops between Neerebup and Jurien Bay so a roadhouse would enable people to stop and refresh themselves as well as top up their fuel tanks. This would help to stop people driving tired which is what causes many accidents through lack of concentration while driving long distances.",115.3564453125,-31.0623454098
