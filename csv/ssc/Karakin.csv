"Karakin","60, Karakin","Other",4,"The original road layout has been modified to provide two lanes southbound after Lancelin Rd. However, the lane layout channells southbound traffic into the right lane right where traffic entering from Lancelin Rd join. Southbound traffic should be directed into the left lane and the right lane used as an originating lane for Lancelin Rd traffic.
