"Wokalup","20 & Mornington Rd, Wokalup","Other",1,"It's a give away sign. Yet no one gives away when there is clearly traffic travelling at 110km/hr. Sheer stupidity & impatience. Possibly requires lights, a lot of shift workers use the intersection on their way back from work are impatient & pull out. Several accidents have happened here, will be fatal one day. Almost every trip back from Bunbury someone or up to 2 cars will pull out and floor it away only to hit the 80km zone & still not slow down. Pathetic.",115.8757791894,-33.130027853
