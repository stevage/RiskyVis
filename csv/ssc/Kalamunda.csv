"Kalamunda","Stanhope Rd, Kalamunda","Vegetation/objects block visibility",0,"The intersection is a slightly skewed cross road with give way signs on King Street.

"Kalamunda","Elizabeth St & Railway Rd, Kalamunda","Other",0,"I nominated this previously as it is an area that has had multiple accidents due to the fact that the eye is drawn up Elizabeth Street towards the roundabout on Williams Street. I suggested a roundabout, which I think would annoy people, but seemed like the only solution. Instead some traffic islands have been put in - but I witnessed a near miss two weeks ago, and an accident only a few days later. It doesn't seem to have been resolved.",116.0581433773,-31.9683829088

"Kalamunda","180-250 Mundaring Weir Rd, Kalamunda","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"Because hordes of thoughtless cyclists are flooding this road to punish themselves on weekend mornings, in turn it is causing impatient and frustrated drivers to perform unsafe passing manoeuvres like crossing double white lines around blind corners into oncoming traffic.  The road needs to be modified immensely to make it safe for cyclists because unfortunately I doubt they'll be convinced to go and ride somewhere else more suitable and safer.",116.0860705376,-31.9804782778

"Kalamunda","Canning Rd & Stanhope Rd, Kalamunda","Tight curves or blind crests",0,"It is very difficult to navigate safely from Stanhope Street onto Canning Road turning left or right as Canning Road is a very busy road.  This intersection is on a bend so you have very little view of cars coming from the south and have to move very quick once you deem it is safe to move onto Canning Rd. Looking left onto Canning Rd From Stanhope you can see clearly for quite a distance but not if you look right because of the bend. The cars are on top of you before you know it.",116.0638564825,-31.9829763326
