When wet on a dark night its often very difficult to distinguish where road is. Colours blend into shoulders. Some of the patchies seem to steer the road off line. Some blacked out strips of white shine white so there are two . Very scary road to drive at times. In places the floodings have caused a drift in road so where it should be straight the road drift off line. Narrow hardtop. ",117.7954101563,-32.3191983489
