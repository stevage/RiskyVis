"Kiara","Bottlebrush Dr & Morley Dr E, Kiara","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Intersection with fuel station and shopping centre on one corner of Bottlebrush Dr and Police Stn on the other corner. Difficulty turning into and out of Bottlebrush Dr at most times. On 'cheap' fuel days this becomes a further nightmare due to queuing. With the proposed residential development behind the police stn set to go, it will get worse. Many motorists use the Morley Dr intersection to make U-turns after exiting the fuel station. A light controlled intersection will assist greatly.",115.9386777878,-31.887487769
