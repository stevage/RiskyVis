"North Walpole","Southwest Hwy, Vasse Hwy Intersection to Walpole","Lacks overtaking opportunities",0,"The SW Hwy from Vasse turn off to Walpole is narrow, winding, with very little run off, lots of wildlife, grey nomads who can't keep left and cause a back up of traffic, road trains (both log, milk and fuel), School buses to and from Manjimup, Pemberton schools and lots of big trees close to the road and way too few overtaking opportunities. For most of the time the road edges are broken and eroded. ",116.4990234375,-34.7416124988
