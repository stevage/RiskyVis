"East Perth","66, East Perth","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"I was hit by a car here and had to go to hospital. I have had several near misses, some even malicious. It is poor design. Cars exiting the E Perth train station car park must cross over the bike path with cyclists passing from both the NE and SW before entering onto East Parade. Drivers are too often focused on the cars and not on the cyclists. I believe this location was identified as a major bike accident hotspot for hospitalisations, but not much has been done except for some paint.",115.8779579401,-31.9431540685

"East Perth","east parade","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",1,"It is almost impossible to cross this road in rush hour. there is no break in the traffic and the only opportunity to cross is when the right hand lane is backed up and stationnary which means you only have to play chicken with 1 lane!",115.8775877953,-31.9445196891

"East Perth","8, East Perth","Other",0,"Dangerous location for merging traffic as on-ramp joins road, as cars on road (from tunnel) seeking to change lane to the left (to take upcoming exit ramp), and those from on-ramp are often seeking to change lane to the right - I'm continually amazed they aren't more accidents here",115.8796799183,-31.947608193
"East Perth","66 & Gardiner St, East Perth","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",0,"Cars are traveling a speed into the city and are beginning to jostle for positions for when the road divides into the lanes to go through the tunnel etc. At the same time traffic is speeding towards the lights at the Mt Lawley subway and right hand turn into Gardiner Rd is immediately after a slight bend that restricts drivers views. Anyone turning right is vulnerable to a rear end accident as they wait to get across with traffic speeding up behind. It is inevitable that a major accident will oc",115.8782958984,-31.9394167162
"East Perth","Terrace Rd, East Perth","Vehicles travel over the speed limit",4,"High volume traffic including heavy construction vehicles use Terrace Rd at speed to avoid traffic lights on Adelaide Tce.  Cars, motorbikes speed around access to/from Causeway and along Riverside Dve. Many vehicles fail to stop at Bennet St / Terrace Rd stop sign. Cars parked both sides of road make it dangerous for pedestrians, families trying to access Langley Park and the river with no defined safe crossing points.

The Inconsistent ODD angle of the cross road makes lines of sight confusing..A custom Roundabout would simplify the intersection - to Watch for Pedestrians And GIVE WAY TO THE RIGHT.. Very Simple..At the moment it is Look Right - Easily, but Look Left is at a tight angle, and Through Traffic has the Right of way..Large pedestrian numbers come this way particularly after Gloucester Park or W.A.C.A events..",115.874004364,-31.9579153515
