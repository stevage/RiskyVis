"Kalgoorlie","Lane St, Kalgoorlie","Other",0,"The entry/exit out of the Woolworths shopping centre is uncontrolled and too close to the Brookman Street roundabout. Vision is obscured by street parking and vehicles exit the roundabout too quickly making it unsafe to cross Lane Street and exit the carpark. There should not be any street parking and that space might be more effective as a turning lane. I would recommend building another roundabout at the shopping centre entrance/exit to facilitate the crossing of traffic.",121.4680865407,-30.7502358758
