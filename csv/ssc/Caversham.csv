"Caversham","203, Caversham","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"West Swan road is absolutely awful. There is so much traffic in this area due to new suburbs being built and people commuting to work that at both sets of traffic lights and the roundabouts, you can have traffic backed up especially in peak hour. I have seen cars pass on solid double white lines and almost cause accidents. This road would also benefit from dual lanes going both ways. It is time that the roads caught up with the expansion of the area as it will only get busier",115.9744691849,-31.8799309496
"Caversham","203 & 3, Caversham","Tight curves or blind crests",2,"When facing north on West Swan Rd and taking a right turn onto Reid Highway (heading east), the turn right arrow turns off allowing those turning right to turn (but give way). In peak hour traffic every single time this happens 2-3 cars run a red light. Also, the traffic they are giving way to is going 70kmph through the intersection and going around a tight bend on a Crest - it is incredibly difficult to see which lane cars are in and easy to make mistake. It's very stressful turning right here",115.9866115284,-31.8638303311

"Caversham","203 & Hamersley Rd, Caversham","Other",0,"Left turning lane traffic obscures traffic coming on the outside 2 lanes. Unsafe to turn until traffic completly clear. There have been several serious and fatal accidents.3",115.9750089585,-31.888366283
"Caversham","39-39 Bennett St, Caversham","Other",0,"Ellenbrook residents are using ir as rat run from Reid highway to Benara road.  Driving too fast for a residential street.  Too high a volume of traffic.  Need to hurry up and complete roadwork.",115.9597277641,-31.8722915094
"Caversham","3, West Swan","Lacks overtaking opportunities",2,"High traffic volumes. Nowhere to overtake slow or heavy vehicles. Frequent congestion. People taking unnecessary risks.",115.9789703592,-31.8635634594
"Caversham","76 & Valley Brook Rd, Caversham","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Insufficient room for vehicles to pass cars turning off Benara Road into Valley Brook road -this can simply be rectified by widening the verge /kerbing by half a car width where there is plenty of room -rear end collisions and traffic hold ups can be prevented here !",115.9575605392,-31.8756170442
