"Tapping","60 & Ashley Rd, Tapping","Poor or confusing signage",1,"at the moment; Heading north on Wanneroo road turning right into Ashley road- cars need to give way to the cars turning right into Ashley road coming FROM north heading south. This is very confusing to everyone as there is usually a give-way sign and dotted lines in the turning lane to stop the traffic heading south on Wanneroo road turning into Ashley road. I have seen many accidents on this intersection and the retaining wall to corner block is ALWAYS demolished due to cars crashing into it.",115.7872349024,-31.7253268092
