Because of the poor conditions on this road mother and many others ive talked to have had accidents on this road. My mum ended up in hospital with damage to her knee, wrist and neck, going around a corner with no street light and went into a ditch and straight into a tree. There is also a terrible blind corner off of Farmview Drive. ",116.0315090418,-31.9041615942
