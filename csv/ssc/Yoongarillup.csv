"Yoongarillup","Myrtle Vale, Yoongarillup","Poor or no guard/barrier fencing",0,"Having seen this section of road (with Sabina River crossing) in winter, there urgently needs to be a guard rail on both sides of highway.  The drop off into the river is right on verge and there are no markers or rails or posts, and when the drain is filled with water it is deep and dangerous and no one would escape if a wheel went over the verge.   Please consider guard rails here as this is an accident waiting to happen.",115.4397010803,-33.7212699677
