"Osborne Park","5-7 Parkland Rd, Osborne Park","Poor or no provision for cyclists",1,"Two major intersections with trucks and Utes turning. Hundreds of workers in the new office blocks. Parents dropping off schoolkids (probably the most dangerous of all!). A dangerous piece of road. The main thing that needs doing is to make the Montessori school carpark exit LEFT TURN ONLY. Speed limit should be 40km/h at ALL times on this road.",115.8157896996,-31.9163610402

"Osborne Park","75, Osborne Park","Other",2,"There exists a perfectly good on-ramp to the freeway which is restricted to buses and taxis only located between the car dealership and Glendalough train station. This should be opened up to traffic and thus reduce the congestion at the intersection of Scarborough Beach Road and Harborne Street as well as the intersection of Harborne Street and Powis.",115.8237719536,-31.9143575095
"Osborne Park","2, Osborne Park","Other",0,"Hutton street off ramp, left hand lane terminates into the off ramp yet there is plenty of road that is painted out where the lane could continue on. Their are always drivers in the left hand lane who do not realise that the lane exits the freeway so they try to change lanes at the last minute which is difficult given our freeways do not have enough lanes.

"Osborne Park","Eldorado St & Main St, Osborne Park","Confusing layout",0,"At the intersection of Main St/ Eldorado St is a slip lane for turning either right when heading north on Main, or right when heading south along Main. When 2 cars from opposite directions are trying to turn right at the same time it creates a hazard as it's very hard to see oncoming traffic behind them. This intersection is too close to the lights at intersection of Hutton/Royal which gets busy during peak. But people have to turn here because so many right turns off Main are blocked.",115.828063488,-31.8947205994
