"Nedlands","Aberdare Rd & Gairdner Dr, Shenton Park","Confusing layout",1,"Travelling west on Aberdare, many cars turn right into Derby, but often indicate late. If you are behind one of these turning cars, you have to stop - but - the traffic behind zooms around you on the INSIDE. There is only ONE lane, so this ""inside passing"" is really risky.

"Nedlands","98-104 Stirling Hwy, Nedlands","Other",0,"Stirling Highway has become more and more congested over the years and now the government wants to increase the population density and businesses, particularly by adding two shopping centers at the Captain Stirling site. I understand that the vehicle movement increase will be in the order of 60,000 per week. Stirling Highway at this point cannot be widened and may need additional traffic lights within 200m of the Dalkeith Road lights.  ",115.8025074005,-31.9793953112
