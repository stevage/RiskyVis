"Currambine","Canterbury Cir & Connolly Dr, Currambine","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",0,"When Pedestrians are turning left from Connolly Drive onto Canterbury Circuit, the paved pathway ends. This means that pedestrians must cross over to the other side of the intersection, only to then cross back over once on Canterbury circuit. I see many people not doing this and simply using the road instead which is dangerous as vehicles commonly turn at this intersection. The paved pathway should continue around Connolly drive onto Canterbury.",115.746486783,-31.7406590316

"Currambine","Chesapeake Way, Currambine","Confusing layout",2,"There is confusion from every vehicle at this intersection. Cars with right of way travelling on the main thoroughfare signal right with no need to do so. Cars that are supposed to give way do not. And cars that are supposed to stop do so once before pulling out into two-way traffic. There is no need for the stop sign AND give way sign, just a single give way sign is sufficient if the main two-way thoroughfare is identified. The confusion is justified - the worst junction I have ever seen. ",115.7385957241,-31.7403761807
