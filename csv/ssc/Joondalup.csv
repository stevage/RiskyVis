The speed limit is 70km/hour and drivers who feel pressure from banked up traffic behind them will take risks to turn whilst visibility is blocked.  Problem is compounded by inexperienced ECU students on P-Plates and international drivers.   A roundabout would help slow down traffic and improve visibility.",115.7695913315,-31.7541253863

"Joondalup","2, Joondalup","Other",0,"This is a comment for all on-ramps. One of the biggest issues with failing to merge effectively onto the Freeway, is that the 100kmh sign is too close to the freeway. It should be at the beginning of the on ramp to allow people to get up to the speed of the freeway, thereby allowing drivers to match the speed of freeway traffic rather than creating massive shunts. On this particular section, it is a large hill and many vehicles struggle to hit 100kmh by the time they are trying to merge.",115.7509660721,-31.7230202548

It has a right turn arrow, but when this changes to green for both directions along Shenton Ave, people think they can go through, but the visibility is not as easy as it first looks and the hit cars on the corner as they turn in front of them.
