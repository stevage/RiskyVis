"Dale","Dale Kokeby Rd, Dale","Poor road surface quality",0,"Dale Kokeby Road surface is very corrugated and loose in the Beverley Shire section of this road.  In the Brookton Shire the same road is in excellent condition. Vehicles are driving on incorrect side of road and cutting corners to avoid the really poor sections of road. Motorists  are using alternative longer routes to reach their destinations. Overhanging vegetation adds to the risks.  Unfortunately this 4km section of road has been in this poor condition for the most of 2018.",116.8108463287,-32.2697166318
