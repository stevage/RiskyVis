"South Fremantle","303 Hampton Rd, South Fremantle","Speed limit too high",1,"North of Rockingham Road, Hampton Road should be a 50 zone (or less). Very difficult for pedestrians to cross at any point. VERY short pedestrian-cross phase at lights. Very dangerous turning right on or off Hampton Road as few breaks in traffic causes risk taking. Very high traffic zone in a long-standing problem area with various unsuccessful 'fixes' over the years. Bus lane often used by  frustrated regular traffic = dangerous for pedestrians & cyclists. Too many close traffic lights. SLOW IT",115.7596135139,-32.0738019357

"South Fremantle","Hampton Rd & Scott St, Beaconsfield","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",0,"The road has a bus lane and a traffic lane. When crossing the road, with often heavy traffic, it is often difficult to judge when it is safe to cross, as people will use the bus lane to overtake turning cars, or just because they think traffic is too slow. To go to the shopping centre one either has to use Lefroy Rd lights, or cross at Douro Rd, which is too dangerous due to people driving through yellow/red lights which does not give enough time to cross.

"South Fremantle","12 & Hampton Rd, South Fremantle","Poorly timed traffic light system",0,"The pedestrian green light is far too short and cars start turning left into the pedestrians whilst they are still crossing from the east side of Hampton Rd to the west side. Cars travelling north go through on the orange so cars turning right to head west end up having to go through on the red or even just get stuck in the intersection. I use this intersection as a pedestrian, cyclist and motorist and it is dangerous on all counts. Need to change traffic light timing.",115.7584762573,-32.0744292289
