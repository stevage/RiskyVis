","Caleb: None","Rebecca: There are two lanes of traffic stopping at the lights intersecting Scarborough Bch Rd and Main St facing East. Across the lights the road splits left up Green St and Right carrying on Scarborough bch rd. One lane goes left and both lanes can go right. However from the other side of the lights you really only see the road going up the hill of Green St.  I commonly see cars in the right hand lane drive straight up Green street narrowly missing hitting cars in the left lane who are going right","Gavin: This is a well know danger spot.  When travelling west on SBR I've nearly been hit by a car coming off Green St.  Having two lanes end on Green Street then crossing to a median to head west on SBR just doesn't work.","None","Hayden: None","Roger: None","Mark: None","","James: Leaving Green Street travelling west onto Scarborough Beach Road  it is a difficult angle to to see two lanes of vehicles approaching from the east while at the same time judging the gap of vehicles approaching from the west from Main Street and Scarborough Beach Road,","Tim: Accidents","Chris: Traffic westbound on Green St not stopping at compulsory stop sign,traffic in outside lane eastbound on Scarborough Beach Rd crossing lane to enter Green St, right turn lane from Scarborough Beach Rd to Main St blocked by traffic from Green St","","Martin:","None","None","Zebulon: None","Shu: I ALWAYS get cut off here. Horrible, horrible section of road. I purposely drive 10 minutes out of my way to go to work to avoid it. ","Claude: Vehicles entering from Green Street wanting to turn left at Powis are unable to do so at many times of the day.  Vehicles entering from  Green Street block the Scarborough Beach Road traffic heading east. Vehicles travelling east on SBR and wishing to access Green Street get into the right hand land and cause chaos when wanting to cut across traffic legally travelling up SBR.","Chloe: The stop sign should be more of a yeild (espically t quiet times when the traffic lights are green, and you are coming down Green St hill, heading for Scarb. Beach Road). When you cross the intersection and join Scarb. Beach Road (before the lights) it is confusing with 3 lanes - people don't know whether to keep left in the island part, if the are turning left, OR using the middle lane. The grey area is if you are keeping in the middle lane, which part of the island do you take, L or R half?","Chloe: None","Mladen : None","Paul: None","Carmel : Cars and trucks trying to cross over all lanes of traffic to get to Brady street to get to freeway entry.

Traffic two or three cars abreast which has exited green street sitting in the middle of the road waiting to get onto scarb beach road then confusion as to which cars move into which lanes/drivers dangerously choosing for themselves","paul: Very difficult to turn right from green street into Scarborough beach road as the intersection is usually full of vehicles waiting at the stop lights. Very bad angle to look for on coming traffic coming along scarborough beach road when you have crossed into the small median strip area.","Liz: None","Paul: None","Elizabeth : Drivers go left into Green Street from right hand lane cutting off traffic going straight ahead on Scarborough Beach Road.

The other way is just as dangerous, so many people driving down Green St, towards Osborne Park, not knowing the proper road transition as there are no road markings. For references, the left lane of Green St should merge into the left lane of Scarborough Beach Rd and the right lane should merge into the right lane and/or the right turning lane.","Andrew: The intersection is to congested being so close to traffic lights. plus the angle of the intersectionn  makes visability challenging. impatient motorists exasibate the issues. The major concern is the west bound traffic. ","Sandra: Ridiculous intersection with little opportunity to cross safely","None","Gary: Two main roads intersecting in a very dangerous manner. Vehicles coming down Green St have to cross the busy Scarborough Beach Rd.","Gabe: None","Graham: Low angle entry intersection from Green Street.
