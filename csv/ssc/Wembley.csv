"Wembley","2, Wembley","Poorly timed traffic light system",0,"At peak hour traffic gets banked back from exit at Powis Street to nearly all the way back to Leederville. The cars at the Powis St lights that are turning right block cars exiting from the freeway and from turning left. It can be difficult to merge given the different speeds in the lanes.  Cars constantly stop and start on the freeway with other cars going at speed trying to merge into a gap.",115.8269262314,-31.9242108175
"Wembley","Powis St, Glendalough","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",7,"Traffic on Powis Street on-ramp to freeway can get so backed up during peak hour that it causes issues with cars trying to squeeze in close to on-ramp rather than wait in line.  I have seen some drivers abusing each other trying to do this, and they can often block the left lane trying to merge into the right lane to go up the on-ramp.",115.825252533,-31.9226081332

My life has been destroyed by an idiot doing this and driving into the driver's side of my car, I have permanent and severe spinal damage.  MANY cars have been observed ignoring the stop sign. Intersection is too big - idiots take chances. REduce the width of Pangbourne entering Ruislip.  Or put in boom gates and traffic lights.",115.8127641678,-31.937559364

"Wembley","26-42 Barrett St, Wembley","Poor or confusing signage",0,"Due to late and poor signation, drivers do not have enough warning warning to get into the correct lane until the last minute. I frequently see drivers in completely the wrong lane and they try to change at the last minute, and have to cut across two or three lanes. Many drivers who are not familiar with the road do not know which lane to be in, so that they can go through the tunnel, northbridge or the Narrows, they try to change at the last minute and they are a hazard to themselves and others",115.8231067657,-31.9395988075

"Wembley","Gregory St & Ruislip St, Wembley","Other",0,"There are no obstructions but a lot of cars pull out in front of others at this intersection. Maybe it�۪s the rise or angle of the road but when travelling east on Ruislip Street and you stop and look to the left and then look again and it looks clear and you go and then suddenly a car or bicycle appears out of nowhere. I have had neighbors and a few people from work mention this intersection before.
