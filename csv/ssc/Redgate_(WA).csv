"Redgate (WA)","Boodjidup Rd & Caves Rd, Redgate","Vegetation/objects block visibility",0,"Two roads meet at the bottom of two hills. Vehicles turning south down caves road immediatly on to a bridge suddenly have fast moving trucks or tourist buses bearing down on them from around a blind bend. I have lived here for 34 years and have seen many near misses. If the turning vehicle is towing a caravan it's even more dangerous. I have seen trucks skid pass the turning vehicle on the wrong side of the road on a two lane bridge. There needs to be a warning sign north of the intersection.",115.0287807239,-34.011278077
