"Brentwood (WA)","38-60 Selway Rd, Brentwood","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"This road is the continuation of the main cycle route into the city. Cyclists exit the southern cycle-way at 90 degrees to the road. Cyclist have a poor view of vehicular traffic and often ride out onto the road in front of cars without looking first. Cars parked opposite the cycle-way exacerbate the issue. There are no barriers to slow cyclists and no convex mirror to assist in viewing the road. It is only a matter of time before a cyclist is killed or badly injured.",115.8540165424,-32.0444052392
