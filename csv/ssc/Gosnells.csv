"Gosnells","Main St, Gosnells","Confusing layout",1,"Back up of traffic due to train crossing, spilling over into Albany Hwy. Poor layout of road means parked cars are in the way of through traffic. Poor signage means vehicles that are in the right turn only lane often go straight, causing many near misses and frustration. Crashes occur at this intersection often due to poor visibility of turning vehicles and drivers blocking through traffic. Only a matter of time before a pedestrian is injured or killed as they come out from the station.",115.999199152,-32.0708290525
"Gosnells","Fremantle Rd & King St, Gosnells","Tight curves or blind crests",0,"Round about is very poorly designed and far too small and tight. Two lanes into one through the roundabout then back to two lanes .Roundabout is offset ,making the exit from King st into Fremantle rd dangerous due to lack of vision down Fremantle rd in both directions.  Once again the camber of the road is extreme.",115.9909272194,-32.0679015317

I believe there should be traffic light on this intersection as the lanes are too narrow and because of being very near to another set of lights and train signal lot of traffic builds up when it's busy.",116.0002344847,-32.0737928444
