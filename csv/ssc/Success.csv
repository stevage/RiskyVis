"Success","14 & Beeliar Dr, Jandakot","Other",8,"I understand this may be more of a behavioural issue but multiple times a day, this intersection is severly blocked by vehicles who've stopped in the middle of the intersection trying to get through the lights. I believe a red light camera would deter people from doing this which in turn would free up the surrounding roads (especially the one going into Gateways Shopping Centre).",115.85407018660003,-32.12862383340002

"Success","14, Success","Other",1,"WA has brought into effect the most stupid rule for entering the freeway in Australia. All our lives we have been told to give way to the RIGHT. NOW we have to give way to the LEFT but only on the freeway. This is causing traffic jams on a saturday at 1100 hrs. This new law should be scrapped and make the freeway safer.

"Success","Alabaster Dr & Wentworth Pde, Success","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",1,"People exiting from the undercover parking at the medical centre are forced south on Wentworth Parade and often do a u turn at the Alabaster road interesection frequently. There are frequent near misses with cars traveling east on Alabaster that are turning left onto Wentworth. The intersection desperately needs a 'No upturn' sign.
