"Leederville","61 & 72, Leederville","Poor road markings or no edge-lines",2,"The right turn facing north on Loftus has a very tight turn lane marking. The line extending forward isn't even a car length before turning right. So cars in left turn end up cutting across you!  The line needs extend at least another 2 metres forward before turning.. To give the right turn lane a chance to move before being cut off. ",115.8465748516,-31.936496836
"Leederville","Oxford St, Leederville","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",0,"High volume of train station foot traffic vs road layout and pedestrian facilities",115.8411687613,-31.9387634606
"Leederville","Oxford St & Vincent St, Leederville","Poor or confusing signage",3,"There are several no right hand turn signs at this intersection.  These are necessary to ensure traffic flow, but are frequently ignored.  Worst offenders are taxi drivers who completely ignore the signs, which inflames other road users.  I think a fixed camera would effectively record infringementsand eventually get the message across!  ",115.8412384987,-31.9364485767
"Leederville","2, West Leederville","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"Fast moving traffic on the Mitchell Highway moving south makes it extremely difficult to merge and cross to the right-hand side of the Mitchell Highway to veer south towards South Perth.",115.8382480072,-31.9357168338
"Leederville","2, Leederville","Poor or confusing signage",1,"Drivers are often not in the correct lane, and because of 'late' signage , they try to change lane at the last minute , which is too late and dangerous. the signs need to start being installed immediately after Powis Street, then installed at least twice more before the Freeway splits into 3. Visitors probably would not be able to find FWY on their GPS/map.",115.8438938856,-31.9411670542
