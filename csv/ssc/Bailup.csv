"Bailup","Bailup Rd & Burma Rd, Bailup","Speed limit too high",0,"People drive very fast on both Bailup Road and Burma Road, and we often hear how people slide towards the intersection of Burma towards Bailup as they try to stop in time. Bailup road is very narrow (especially close to Wundowie), hilly and lined with trees. We often have to swerve onto the gravel verge of the road when passing a vehicle from the front because of the vehicle's high speed and tendency to drive in the middle of the narrow road - a dangerous and scary experience!!!",116.3084793091,-31.7583856746
