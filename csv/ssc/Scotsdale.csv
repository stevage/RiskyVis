"Scotsdale","Denmark-Mount Barker Rd, Hay","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",1,"This is a route between Mount Barker and Denmark which I have been through many times with my parents during my childhood. The road quality is atrocious for the high speeds. If I have the choice to drive via SW Hwy or Albany Hwy, then I will actively avoid Albany Hwy due to Denmark-Mount Barker Rd. I legitimately prepare for death each time I travel on this road.",117.3805475235,-34.9428346785
"Scotsdale","25-109 Denmark-Mount Barker Rd, Hay","Poor road surface quality",0,"Without a doubt the worst road in Wa. It has no shoulders and is frequently used by heavy vehicles giving tourists and caravans nowhere to go. I challenge anyone to find a more dangerous stretch of road in this state as I have driven most of them. Nearly 15000 vehicles use that road in two weeks leading up to Christmas",117.3802471161,-34.9480057893
