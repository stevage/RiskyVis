","Janet: When driving east along Hardey Rd as you near the junction where Alexander Rd is - if you are  on Hardey Rd and someone is turning right out of Alexander Rd into Hardey Rd you really have to watch the traffic as the person turning right is very close to you as you go straight along Hardey Rd. If you have driven through the Hardey Rd and Alexander Rd section it is a strange section of road. I think a roundabout would suit this intersection much better. Please change it.","Greg: Traffic travelling east on hardy road and continueing east at the ninety degree change into alexander rd do northam slow down when entering the suburban street. houses hear this intersection and pedestrians are at risk of serious injury as these ""exiting"" vehicles are travelling too fast. also the intersection is confusing, it requires a redesign to force ""exiting"" trfaffic to slow down, to the point of significant physical barriers to force compliance, a change in road surface colour etc.","None","Very difficult turning off Hardey Rd since it's difficult to judge what direction cars are turning from Hardey Rd (southbound)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",115.93946367506072,-31.951493142065374
