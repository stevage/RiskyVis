"Heathridge","Caridean St & Hodges Dr, Heathridge","Distraction issues",4,"In my 30 years of living on the Connolly side of this intersection, I've heard around 50 accidents of people and animals. More recently I lay in bed and heard an animal run down by a car. This intersection was also the scene of a horrific accident that killed a motorcyclist a couple of years ago when a 4WD ploughed into the back of a row of cars. Most accidents are traveling west into the Sun or cars coming down Carridean and not realising it ends at traffic lights. It needs more obvious signage",115.7538034467,-31.7550226541
