"Manning","Downey Dr & Marsh Ave, Manning","Area requires lights/roundabout",0,"Although this isn't the busiest intersection it is different from the ones close by. Majority roads coming off of Marsh have either a give way of stop sign and the driers along Marsh have right of way. Most vehicles coming off of Manning road along Marsh do not slow down or stop even though Downey Drive users have the right of way on this section and Marsh Ave have a give way sign. I cross this intersection numerous times a day and will often have close dangerous encounters, ",115.871810317,-32.0126270045
"Manning","Challenger Ave & Henning Cres, Manning","Area requires lights/roundabout",0,"Challenger Ave has right of way with only a give way sign on Henning Cr. Due to poor visibility with trees and curved road placed further up to deter speeding this intersection really should be changed into either a roundabout or stop sign for safety.",115.8739131689,-32.0134912454
"Manning","Ley St & Paterson St, Como","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"Ley st congestion would be greatly improved if either a round about was placed or a slip road placed for Manning School collection as drivers coming from Paterson St often can not turn right into Ley st with cars backed up flowing along Ley street from Manning road. Only 1/2 the cars are blocking the area due to no slip lane for a kiss ad drive and wanting to stay to the left where as the other half of the cars are trying to continue along the road or turn right into a church carpark.",115.8640748262,-32.0154698716
