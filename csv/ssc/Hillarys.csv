"Hillarys","71 & Cook Ave, Hillarys","Poor or confusing signage",0,"Turning right into Banks from Marmion with the lights is often dangerous because cars  northbound can filtering into one lane. Cars filtering in generally just barge in stopping the flow of legitimate cars turning right with the lights. Maybe a controlled left arrow for the northbound traffic would make it safer",115.7538414001,-31.8021631379
"Hillarys","Endeavour Rd, Hillarys","Other",3,"Highly congested road often with traffic accessing Bunnings and other commercial properties on one side and a servo and shopping centre on the other. The road also carries through traffic. Pedestrians, including school kids take considerable risks crossing the road in peak traffic times. A foot bridge or undrpass would alleviate things",115.7453870773,-31.7978866285
"Hillarys","Whitfords Ave, Hillarys","Vegetation/objects block visibility",0,"There is at least 3 areas here where the hedges are too high. If you are in a sedan there is no way you can see. To add to it the road has bends so it�۪s twice as dangerous.",115.7511162758,-31.7958554452
"Hillarys","Hepburn Ave & Southside Dr, Hillarys","Poor road markings or no edge-lines",0,"",115.7419538498,-31.8220567901
"Hillarys","Cumberland Dr, Hillarys","Unsafe or poor pedestrian crossing",0,"Similar to nomination at Ocean Reef/Dampier and Ventura roundabouts. These new roundabouts have cycle path crossings in direct line of vehicles' momentum. If inattentive drivers do not follow the curve prior to entering the roundabout they will most certainly drive into path crossing zone. New vehicle barriers to mitigate this have been placed at roundabout at entrance to St. Mark's school, but there are other new roundabouts where this risk has not been fixed.",115.737836659,-31.7981579055
