"Moore","2, Joondalup","Other",0,"This is a comment for all on-ramps. One of the biggest issues with failing to merge effectively onto the Freeway, is that the 100kmh sign is too close to the freeway. It should be at the beginning of the on ramp to allow people to get up to the speed of the freeway, thereby allowing drivers to match the speed of freeway traffic rather than creating massive shunts. On this particular section, it is a large hill and many vehicles struggle to hit 100kmh by the time they are trying to merge.",115.7509660721,-31.7230202548
