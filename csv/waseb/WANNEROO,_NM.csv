"WANNEROO, NM","60 & Ashley Rd, Tapping","Poor or confusing signage",1,"at the moment; Heading north on Wanneroo road turning right into Ashley road- cars need to give way to the cars turning right into Ashley road coming FROM north heading south. This is very confusing to everyone as there is usually a give-way sign and dotted lines in the turning lane to stop the traffic heading south on Wanneroo road turning into Ashley road.
