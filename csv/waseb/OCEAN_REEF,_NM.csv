Not only are you looking for this traffic, but also doing so while keeping the car still on a hill, mindful of vehicles behind you. Traffic approaching northbound along Dampier also travel  at high speed, so without advance visibility this also makes it challenging to give way.",115.7423722744,-31.7748730581
