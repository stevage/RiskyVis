"BURNS BEACH, NM","Shenton Ave, Iluka","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"Marmion Avenue is an 80km/h zoe and western side of Shenton Avenue is 50 km/h, eastern side is 70km/h. This is a dual lane roundabout, with no areas for cyclists to safely pass. The pedestrian crossing on the northern side of the roundabout is very close to the roundabout itself. As cars are travelling fast through the roundabout (especially when continuing on Marimion), it leaves very little time for pedestrians or cyclists to safely cross the road.

During peak periods people get frustrated at the long waiting times giving way to their right and some make risky moves when they shouldn�۪t to get a foot in. This makes it dangerous for both motorists and cyclists alike. The other intersections south of here are all light-controlled and they work very well.

"BURNS BEACH, NM","2, Joondalup","Other",0,"This is a comment for all on-ramps. One of the biggest issues with failing to merge effectively onto the Freeway, is that the 100kmh sign is too close to the freeway. It should be at the beginning of the on ramp to allow people to get up to the speed of the freeway, thereby allowing drivers to match the speed of freeway traffic rather than creating massive shunts. On this particular section, it is a large hill and many vehicles struggle to hit 100kmh by the time they are trying to merge.",115.7509660721,-31.7230202548
