And the number of tandem trucks that travel on the road will more than trebel once the mine upgrade is complete. This is going to make the road even more unsafe.

"DONNYBROOK-BALINGUP","Goodwood Rd, Paynedale","Tight curves or blind crests",1,"Trucks and cars cross the middle line on the tight blind  bends. The worst was a meter over the line. Motor bikes hug the central line and someone will get taken out. Drivers who don�۪t know the road take the bends way to fast and I have seen up to 20 cars in the bush or paddocks in the past 10 years. We have had a death, we have been called to a motor bike fire when is slid out and ended up in the bush. I would say that at least 15 kms need attention in places. The road is used by cyclists also ",115.8155965805,-33.5908495537
"DONNYBROOK-BALINGUP","Bendall Rd, Donnybrook","Other",0,"When turning from Bendall Road southward onto the Southwest Highway there is no entrance lane.
