"BRIDGETOWN-GREENBUSHES","26154-26154 South Western Hwy, Yornup","Lacks overtaking opportunities",0,"I drive the highway between Bridgetown and Manjimup every day for work. I see many near misses due to lack of safe overtaking practices. This stretch of road has a high volume of traffic including logging trucks, transport trucks, holiday makers, buses and general trafic. The volume has progressively increased over the last few years. If there were overtaking lanes, less risks would need to be taken.",116.2010192871,-34.1214685814
"BRIDGETOWN-GREENBUSHES","15-15 Whittells Rd, Bridgetown","Hazardous roadside objects or trees",0,"Lots of people walking especially school kids from the bus stop, there is no verge to walk on so they have to walk on the road, the road is narrow so 2 cars and a walker can�۪t all safely fit! Huge trees line road and it�۪s bendy and visability is very poor! The road is used as a shortcut to get from one side of town across to the other so it�۪s quite busy and cars do not travel at 60kms - it�۪s used as a rally track because of the bends",116.1484587193,-33.9432086374
