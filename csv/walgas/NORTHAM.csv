At the Yarra Road intersection an overtaking lane heading north approaches a blind corner - I witnessed a Ute ���aquaplane�۝ before flipping over the bonet landing back on the wheels. It is a narrow, winding road with no emergency lane & a very poorly maintained surface. Its a very busy road, especially with the trucks.
