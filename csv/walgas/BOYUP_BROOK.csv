"BOYUP BROOK","6374-6374 Donnybrook-Boyup Brook Rd, Benjinup","Poor road surface quality",0,"We use this road a few times a week and it continues to be an issue of safety, we actually dread using it.  The road has been resurfaced several times but the work done is not up to standard with many logging and livestock trucks using this road.  The road edges are poor and unmarked for much of the road and the ability to overtake safely is limited and often dangerous.  This road needs to be looked at by a qualified engineer and its repairs done properly to fit the traffic that uses it.",116.3335418701,-33.768017359
"BOYUP BROOK","1701-1701 Boyup Brook-Arthur Rd, Dinninup","Tight curves or blind crests",0,"This road is like others in the area where the surface can be poor in some long sections of the road.  It is also very windy and hilly that make it hard to overtake slower vehicles.  Used by heavy trucks and agricultural vehicles the road does require regular repairs that are simply not adequate for the vehicles that use this road.  This is a road safety issue above all else.",116.538848877,-33.7936997285
"BOYUP BROOK","876-876 Six Mile Rd, Boyup Brook","Poor road surface quality",0,"This is an un-surfaced road that is down right dangerous.  Used by heavy trucks and Agricultural vehicles the road is quickly damaged even after recent grading of the road.  This road as a main link between The Boyup brook to Kojonup road and Dinninup needs to be surfaced properly its entire length.  Having often used this road I have nearly been cleaned up over a dozen times by trucks and other uses travelling too fast on this poorly surfaced road even below the speed limit.",116.473274231,-33.8725534812
