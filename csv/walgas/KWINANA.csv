"KWINANA","Liddelow Rd & Rowley Rd, Banjup","Little chance to turn/cross traffic",0,"When heading north from De Haer Rd to Liddelow Rd, there is a dog-leg on Rowley Rd. You have to enter left onto Rowley Rd then stop and turn right onto Liddelow Rd. This causes a problem for traffic heading west on Rowley Rd. They have to slow/stop to allow you to turn - there is no room for them to get around you. The road needs to be widened at this point to create a turning lane.

"KWINANA","1, Kwinana Beach","Confusing layout",0,"This section of the road here has many sets of traffic lights that are very confusing. because it seems that you are able to stop in a very tiny space just before Mason Road.Also it seems that when the traffic lights goes green for vehicles to cross over from Mandurah Road into Patterson Road, vehicles that were already stopping in Patterson road (heading north) sometimes thought that the green was meant for them. However, it was meant for the incoming traffic coming from Mandurah Road only!",115.7773590088,-32.2357458148
"KWINANA","1, Kwinana Beach","Poor or no provision for cyclists",0,"while travelling north on rockingham road on my bicycle the cycling lane disapears at the most dangerous section of road, that being on the approach to the traffic lights. Vehicles are forced to slow down or swing out wide as a cyclist comes in to the vehicle lane to get through the intersection and continue north. Some drivers are loath to do this and I have been squeezed over the kerb on numerous occasions. Thanks",115.7873743773,-32.2260803201

"KWINANA","1 & Mason Rd, Kwinana Beach","Poorly timed traffic light system",0,"Light are timed too long for Rockingham Rd during peak times.
