"DALWALLINU","Northam Pithara Road","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"The road is mostly single lane,windy with sharp bends and blind crests. The road  edging is breaking away and has dangerous drop offs. It is used by heavy agricultural machinery, it also has poor visibility in numerous places due to vegetation growing close to the road edge.There are many kangaroos in the area as well as occasional livestock on the road.It is a major road for the region, is well used and is in very poor condition.I have seen or know of numerous  accidents and near misses",116.71875,-30.5054838989
"DALWALLINU","14173-14173 Northam-Pithara Rd, Marne","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",1,"Only wide enough for one vehicle, road train route and edges can quite often have large drop offs. ",116.7015838623,-30.5001593493

"DALWALLINU","204-216 Locke Rd, Dalwallinu","Other",0,"I have travelled on Indian Ocean Road a number of times recently and note the amount of money being put into more passing lanes. Unfortunately, on each journey lately I've noticed that drivers, possibly oversea tourists, do not understand how to use them and completely block the lane. We love having tourists but I think we need to introduce a visitor permit, training scheme to prevent more of these fatal accidents and so many near misses.",116.6033935547,-30.268556249
"DALWALLINU","498-498 Syme Rd, Wubin","Other",0,"Manuel road carries the most traffic, vehicles including loaded grain trucks travelling South have a short section of visibility after coming over a hill. Syme road is much less used, the angle of the intersection would allow Syme road to be aligned at right angles to Manuel road in both directions creating a stop situation for Syme road traffic. There is space for this, half a day with a grader would do it. I suggested this to our past Shire Councillor some time ago.",116.6728815436,-30.0569484801
