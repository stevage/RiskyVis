"BROOMEHILL-TAMBELLUP","34370-34370 Great Southern Hwy, Cranbrook","Tight curves or blind crests",0,"Night driving hazard caused by new style blinding headlights of oncoming traffic. Particularly with some truck headlights at a height that are blinding even on low beam. With the curves and crests between Katanning and Cranbrook many oncoming drivers with super silver lights - appear not to be able to see standard normal oncomming lights and do not lower their lights correctly. The problem is not so much the condition of the road - but after market silver white lights not set or used correctly.",117.6690673828,-34.1561362877
"BROOMEHILL-TAMBELLUP","Albany","Other",0,"Severe traffic congestion in peak hours. Poor vision when looking turning right and needing to look left at all times of the day.
