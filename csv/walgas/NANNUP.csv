"NANNUP","Brockman Hwy, East Nannup","Other",1,"Road is too narrow. Views obstructed by trees very close to road. Kangaroos abound. I have hit 6! I travel 20km hr below recommend speed limit. Steep edges in one section that goes uphill for 5 km. No barriers.. winding road with little or no chance to overtake. Major tourist road between Nannup and Bridgetown. Very dangerous",115.8048248291,-33.9957501593
"NANNUP","Brockman Hwy, East Nannup","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"This stretch of road between Bridgetown and Nunnup is extremely narrow and the surface of the road itself is poor and can be quite bumpy in parts. The edges of the lanes also have no edges meaning if someone were to swerve they would fall off into ditch and trees.",115.9612083435,-34.0182338775
"NANNUP","9842-9852 Vasse Hwy, Peerabeelup","Narrow road, lanes or bridges",0,"Conflict between cars, trucks, caravans and international visitors. Motorists regularly exceed the speed limit. I regularly see vehicles crossing the centre line into the oncoming lane and overtaking on solid white lines",115.774269104,-34.3277019196
"NANNUP","Vasse Hwy, Cundinup","Poor or no guard/barrier fencing",0,"Heading south towards Nannup, you come over the hill and head towards the St Johns brook bridge, and the road leads in a direct line off the bridge into the deep drain.  The bridge and road after is curved away.  There is no guard rail at all, and every time I pass this patch of road, it chills me how just a slight error or misjudgment would spell death, especially if the river was flooded during wet season.  Guard rails are definitely needed on north side of this bridge!!!",115.694360733,-33.82368841
"NANNUP","3260-3260 Balingup-Nannup Rd, Nannup","Poor road surface quality",0,"Rubble wash down onto road.  Braking is not recommended.  However, I stepped brake when I approached a crest too soon.  I tried to straighten my steering.  My Ford Falcon StationWagon, spun 360 degrees, skidded to the opposite side of road, hit a wooden fence, bounced into the air, flipped upside down, and car landed in a 3 metre ditch on it's bonnet.  I was dangling upside down fastened to my seatbelt.",115.7882595062,-33.9495544933
