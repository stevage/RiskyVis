"CORRIGIN","Rabbit Proof Fence Rd, Corrigin","Vegetation/objects block visibility",1,"Travelling on Brookton Highway crossing the Fence Road intersection is very dangerous - there's been several accidents & plenty more near misses. Vehicles travelling on Fence Rd fail to register there is a cross road & travel straight through without stopping. Also travelling in a westerly direction on Brookton Highway you are down in a valley, there are trees & you can't see vehicles travelling north on the Fence Road before it's too late.

"CORRIGIN","Corrigin-Quairading Rd, Corrigin","Lacks median strip/traffic separation",0,"Terrible road on wet nights. No markings, missing markings, p[atchy repairs. When wet on a dark night its often very difficult to distinguish where road is. Colours blend into shoulders. Some of the patchies seem to steer the road off line. Some blacked out strips of white shine white so there are two . Very scary road to drive at times. In places the floodings have caused a drift in road so where it should be straight the road drift off line. Narrow hardtop. ",117.7954101563,-32.3191983489
